Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The Entity Attack piece [prefix{}]
The Drone will attack every living creature within the area. Keep in mind that the Area pieces connected to an Entity Attack piece always will be interpreted with cuboid mode, regardless of the Area piece's area mode. It's possible to create different shapes, though, by using whitelisting/blacklisting of areas.

You can specify which creatures may be attacked by using Text pieces as an Entity Filter. E.g. if you want the Drone to attack all players, connect a Text piece to the right of the Entity Attack piece containing '@player'. If you don't want to be attacked, connect up a 'Text' piece on the left containing your player name.
This follows the rules of an [link{pneumaticcraft:misc/entity_filter}]entity filter[link{}].

[prefix{l}]Melee Attacks[prefix{}]
Drones will equip and use any melee weapon in their inventory to attack. If a Drone has multiple weapons in its inventory, it will equip the most damaging one. You can use an [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/inventory_import}]Inventory Import[link{}] piece to provide the Drone with a weapon, which is strongly recommended - its unarmed melee attack is weak.

[prefix{l}]Ranged Attacks[prefix{}]
By inserting an Entity Tracker Upgrade into the Drone, the Drone will have a minigun attached to it. When provided with Gun Ammo (using an [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/inventory_import}]Inventory Import[link{}] piece) the Drone will use this minigun to perform ranged attacks on its foes. The default range is 16 blocks, which can be upgraded by inserting up to 16 Range Upgrades, for a maximum range of 32 blocks.
