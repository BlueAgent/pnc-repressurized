This special door will open automatically if there is a player nearby, provided that it has sufficient air pressure. It has a range of 2 blocks but this can be increased by inserting Range Upgrades. When the Pneumatic Door Base is within the range of an operating Security Station it will only open the door when allowed by the Security Station. You can also select the Pneumatic Door to only open when you look at the door, or you can make it behave like a Wooden/Iron Door.

[prefix{l}]Camouflaging [prefix{}]
You can make the Pneumatic Door Base blend in with the environment by camouflaging it with the [link{item/camo_applicator}]Camouflage Applicator[link{}]. It will then use that block to camouflage itself.
