This is a Pressure Chamber. This multi-block structure is used to compress various materials into others. To build a valid Pressure Chamber you have to make a hollow cube out of Pressure Chamber Walls/Windows. The size of the cube can vary from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5. It doesn't matter whether you use walls or windows. Next you need to make one hole where you place your Pressure Chamber Valve. The Valve has to connect to the air blocks in the Pressure Chamber. You need at least one Valve per Pressure Chamber, but you can add more. When you've successfully built the Pressure Chamber, you'll be able to open the interface of the Pressure Chamber when you right-click any block of it.

[prefix{l}]Pressure Chamber Interface[prefix{}]
It's also strongly recommended that you have at least one (most likely two) [link{block/pressure_chamber_interface}]Pressure Chamber Interface[link{}] in your Pressure Chamber.  Without any interfaces, you will need to break your Pressure Chamber multi-block to insert or remove items, which causes pressure loss (and is generally just inconvenient).

Interfaces are directional - items are inserted on the face marked with an "I" and removed on the face marked with an "O".  So when you build your multiblock, you'll want (at least) one interface with an "I" on the outside of the multiblock, and one interface with an "O" on the outside.

When you've done this, you reform the Pressure Chamber. Now if you open the user interface (by clicking on any block of the Pressure Chamber other than a Pressure Chamber Interface), you'll see something like shown in the image above. The pressure gauge has a yellow area, meaning the machine only will compress when it hits the green. In the problems tab you can find the exact pressure you need to compress the materials you've put in. To build up pressure, you can direct air through the Valve(s), like shown on the bottom picture.

Since recipes can be dynamically modified by modpacks using CraftTweaker, please use JEI to view all Pressure Chamber recipes; the necessary ingredients and required pressure will be shown.

[prefix{l}]Special Recipes [prefix{}]
A few special "recipes" exist:

• If you can manage to persuade a villager to enter your Pressure Chamber, and provide sufficient pressure, you will get a Mechanic Villager, who may have some useful trades...
• By inserting an enchanted book and an enchantable item, you can transfer the enchantment from the book to the item, without the need to spend experience levels.
• By providing negative pressure to the Pressure Chamber (see the [link{block/vacuum_pump}]Vacuum Pump[link{}]), you can disenchant items.  Insert any enchanted item, and a normal book, and the enchantments will be vacuumed off the item and into the book.
