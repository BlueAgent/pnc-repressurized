The Elevator is a machine that can be used to vertically transport any entities, whether it be an item, mob, animal or player. You need to place an Elevator Base at the bottom. You can stack multiple on top of each other. On top of this you can place Elevator Frames, which act as a support for the elevator. 











Both the number of Elevator Bases and the number of Elevator Frames define how far the Elevator can extend. The maximum height of an Elevator is the lower of:

• 1x the number of vertically-stacked Elevator Frames, or
• 4x the number of vertically-stacked Elevator Bases

(note you can change the "4x" multiplier in mod config - see "I:elevatorBaseBlocksPerBase")

There are two modes the Elevator can operate in:

[prefix{l}]Redstone mode[prefix{}]
A redstone signal (applied to any Elevator Base) will define whether the elevator should ascend or descend. A redstone strength of 0 means the Elevator will go to 0% extension, a redstone strength of 15 means it will go to 100% of the maximum height, and anything in between will raise the Elevator proportionally.

[prefix{l}]Elevator Caller[prefix{}]
The Elevator Caller can provide some more sophisticated control over the elevator: [link{block/elevator_caller}]see its page for more info.[link{}]

[prefix{l}]Expanding in width[prefix{}]
You can create bigger Elevators by connecting more Elevator Bases next to each other horizontally. When the top Elevator Base of every connected Elevator is at the same height, the Elevators will share the floors (defined by Elevator Callers), redstone input, and therefore the desired height.

[prefix{l}]Charging Upgrade[prefix{}]
The Elevator Base can accept up to four Charging Upgrades, which allow it to regenerate air when the elevator descends (normally descent costs no air but does not regenerate air). This comes at a cost of slower descent; with 4 upgrades installed, air is regenerated at 60% of the cost to rise that distance, but descent will be 40% slower.

[prefix{l}]Camouflaging [prefix{}]
You can camouflage the Elevator floor with the [link{item/camo_applicator}]Camouflage Applicator[link{}].
