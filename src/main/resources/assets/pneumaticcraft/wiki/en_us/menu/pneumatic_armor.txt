PneumaticCraft: Repressurized provides a full suit of Pneumatic Armor, each with its own unique abilities, many of which complement each other.  Each armor piece is described in more detail on its own page:

• [link{item/pneumatic_helmet}]Pneumatic Helmet[link{}]
• [link{item/pneumatic_chestplate}]Pneumatic Chestplate[link{}]
• [link{item/pneumatic_leggings}]Pneumatic Leggings[link{}]
• [link{item/pneumatic_boots}]Pneumatic Boots[link{}]

[prefix{l}]Armor Features [prefix{}]
The armor provide good quality protection: the same protection as Iron Armor, but an extra +1 toughness (Iron Armor has +0 toughness, Diamond Armor has +2 toughness).  Its durability is between that of Iron and Diamond (but see the Item Life upgrade below for auto-repair abilities).

Pneumatic Armor provides excellent blast resistance (after all, Compressed Iron is forged in an explosion...)

Pneumatic Armor can be enchanted as normal; its enchantability is equivalent to Iron armor.

All installed features can be controlled/toggled via the armor GUI; this is bound to 'U' by default but can be changed in Settings -> Controls (see the PneumaticCraft section), or via the armor GUI itself.  The toggling of every feature can also be bound to a hotkey (although no toggle hotkeys are bound by default).

[prefix{l}]Common Upgrades [prefix{}]
Upgrades are installed by placing the armor piece in a [link{block/charging_station}]Charging Station[link{}] and opening the upgrades inventory by clicking the "Inv" button.

The following upgrades can be installed in any armor piece and have (generally) the same effect in each piece:

[prefix{n}]Speed Upgrade [prefix{}]
When installed, Speed Upgrades reduce the initialization time of the armor piece.  In addition, Speed Upgrades in the helmet reduce the lock-on time for Entity and Block Tracker Upgrades (but increase the air usage).

[prefix{n}]Volume Upgrade [prefix{}]
Volume Upgrades increase the air storage capacity of each armor piece, making them take longer to charge, but slower to lose pressure when in use.  The only effective limit to the number of Volume Upgrades is the number of available upgrade slots in the armor piece.

[prefix{n}]Armor Upgrade [prefix{}]
By adding Armor Upgrades, the protection level of the Pneumatic Armor suit can be increased.  With 2 Armor Upgrades installed, each piece is as good as the corresponding Diamond armor piece.  With the maximum 6 upgrades, the protection is thus superior to Diamond.

[prefix{n}]Item Life Upgrade [prefix{}]
When installed, Item Life upgrades slowly repair the armor piece, at a cost of air. Up to 6 Item Life Upgrades can be installed in each piece, providing incrementally faster (but less air-efficient) repair.

[prefix{n}]Thaumcraft Upgrade [prefix{}]
When Thaumcraft 6 is installed, these upgrades provide the armor piece with the equivalent vis discount of the corresponding Thaumaturge's armor.  In addition, a Thaumcraft Upgrade installed in the helmet acts as a Goggles of Revealing, showing aura nodes and displaying aspect amounts in containers.
