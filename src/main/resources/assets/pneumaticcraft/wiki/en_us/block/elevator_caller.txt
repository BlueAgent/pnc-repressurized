The Elevator Caller is an 'upgrade' to the [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/elevator}]Elevator [link{}]. See that page for info about the Elevator itself.

Elevator Caller blocks placed next to Elevator Frames are used to control the height of the elevator. When you place down an Elevator Frame, it'll look for an Elevator, and calculate how many floors there are. Floors are defined by other Elevator Callers. As shown in [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/elevator}]the picture on the Elevator page[link{}] , there are four Elevator Callers connected on four different  height levels, so there are four floors. These floors are displayed as buttons on every connected Elevator Caller, which can be pressed to send the Elevator to that floor. You can also apply a redstone signal to the Elevator Caller you want the Elevator to go to (see the button in the picture). An Elevator Caller will emit a redstone signal itself when the Elevator has arrived at the floor of that Elevator Caller.

[prefix{l}]Renaming floors[prefix{}]
Floors can be renamed. You can do this in the GUI of the Elevator Base. When you rename any floors these names will be saved by floor height, not number. This is an important detail, as it means that if you remove a floor in the middle, the names of higher levels won't be shifted down. Likewise when you add a floor it will add a name in between.

[prefix{l}]Camouflaging [prefix{}]
The Elevator Caller can be camouflaged to look like other blocks with the [link{item/camo_applicator}]Camouflage Applicator[link{}] tool.
