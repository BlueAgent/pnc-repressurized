This Hopper behaves just like the Vanilla Hopper. However, this Hopper can be oriented in every direction, not just up. On top of that it accepts Machine Upgrades, which can be used to speed up the Hopper. Finally, it has a custom hitbox which means you can access other blocks by just pointing your crosshair 'through' the Omnidirectional Hopper. It also doesn't use air, making it a perfect early game gadget.

When you place the Hopper, its input will face toward you, and its output will face toward the block it was placed against. Right click the Hopper with a Pneumatic Wrench (or other recognised wrench) to re-orient its input. Sneak & right click the Hopper to re-orient its output.
