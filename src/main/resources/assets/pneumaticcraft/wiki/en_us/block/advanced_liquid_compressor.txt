The Advanced Liquid Compressor is a machine which can produce [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/generating_pressure}]compressed air[link{}]. It's the upgraded version of the [link{block/liquid_compressor}]Liquid Compressor[link{}], generating a base 50ml/tick of air with a maximum safe pressure of 20 bar. It can be upgraded with speed upgrades. However, the machine needs to be [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}] cooled[link{}], as its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
