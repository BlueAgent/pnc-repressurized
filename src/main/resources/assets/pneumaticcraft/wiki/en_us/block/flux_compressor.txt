The Flux Compressor converts Forge Energy (compatible with Redstone Flux and the energy systems of various other mods, including but by no means limited to Immersive Engineering, EnderIO & Actually Additions) into compressed air. It consumes 40 RF/tick by default, but can be upgraded with [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/machine_upgrades}]Speed Upgrades[link{}]. The RF input rate of the Flux Compressor is twice the amount of the current usage. This means it's 80 RF/tick by default, but can be increased via Speed Upgrades.

An important factor that influences efficiency is the machine's temperature. The machine needs to be [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}] cooled[link{}], or its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
