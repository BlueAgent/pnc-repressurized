Micromissiles are small hand-launched missiles with an explosive payload and smart mob targeting.

To fire a Micromissile, simply right-click the missile pod.  Each pod has 100 missiles by default, but this can be adjusted in mod config - see I:missilePodSize.

• Micromissiles will seek targets in a 64-block cubic area, centered on the missile.  Once a suitable target (see entity filtering below) is found, the missile will try to turn toward that target.
• Micromissiles will never target the player who fired the missile or any entity (pets, drones...) belonging to that player. But beware of collateral damage from nearby explosions: micromissiles are not recommended for close quarters combat!
• Micromissiles can target living entities, minecarts & boats, but will not target item entities (dropped items) or other non-living entities such as paintings.
• If a Micromissile hits any entity or block, it will immediately explode.
• The explosion will not damage terrain by default, but this can be enabled in mod config - see B:damageTerrain.
• Micromissiles have a limited lifetime, which is 300 ticks (15 seconds) by default. After that the missile will run out of fuel and drop from the sky, but it will still explode when it hits the ground. This lifetime can be adjusted in mod config - see I:missileLifetime.
• If you aim directly at a suitable entity when firing, the fired Micromissile will immediately lock on to that entity, regardless of what else is nearer.

If you sneak and right-click the pod, a GUI will open allowing configuration of several missile properties:

• The selection triangle allows you to balance between top speed, turn rate and explosion power.
• Note that a very high top speed coupled with a low turn rate can make it very difficult for missiles to hit moving targets.
• You can filter which entities to attack by entering an [link{pneumaticcraft:misc/entity_filter}]entity filter[link{}] in the 'Entity Filter' field.
• The 'Save as Default' button causes the current settings to be saved as default; those settings will then be used for all new missile pods. Note: the settings are saved server-side.
