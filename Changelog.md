# PneumaticCraft: Repressurized - Changelog

This is an overview of significant new features and fixes by release.  See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master for a detailed list of all changes.

Changes are in reverse chronological order; newest changes at the top.

## Minecraft 1.16.3 / 1.16.4

## 2.8.3-?? (unreleased)

### Updates
* Quality of Life: when attaching a tube module to a Pressure Tube, you can now sneak to attach to the opposite side of the tube
* Updated some Patchouli manual information, primarily to clarify drone auto-charging functionality
* Logistics Drones can now take Inventory Upgrades (this was actually already documented in the manual)

### Fixes
* Fixed client crash on player login when ModernUI is installed
* Fixed Pneumatic Armor not reporting feature on/off status properly to server when armor newly equipped
  * Logging in with armor already equipped worked fine, which is why it took some time to spot this bug...
* Reset step assist height when Pneumatic Boots are removed

## 2.8.2-97 (28 Dec 2020)

### Updates
* The Coordinate Operator progwidget can now operate upon a specific subset of the X/Y/Z coordinate fields if desired
  * Choose which fields should be affected in the widget's GUI
  * Default is all of X/Y/Z, i.e. same behaviour as previously
* Programmable Controllers can no longer mine themselves up via the Dig progwidget
* Smart Chest filtering: Alt + Left Click with an item on the cursor now sets that item as a filter if possible
  * This can also be done on "closed" slots in the chest's GUI
  * Useful to be able to update a filter without needing to open up a closed slot (potentially allowing unwanted items in)
* Added Void Fluid progwidget, counterpart to the Void Item widget added back in 2.4.5
* The Programmable Controller can now charge the minidrone's held item (pressure or RF) significantly faster than before
  * This makes Jackhammers in vein+ mode highly suitable for use in a very fast quarry...
* It is now possible to configure the likelihood of Oil Lakes generating at the surface
  * See pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> General -> `surface_oil_generation_chance`
  * This is 25% by default (i.e. if an Oil Lake would generate at the surface, there is only a 25% chance that it will actually generate)
  * Can be set to 0 to disable surface Oil Lakes entirely
  * Note that raising/lowering this value also raises/lowers the overall number of Oil Lakes generated, so you may also wish to modify `oil_generation_chance` if you modify this setting and want to keep a similar number of lakes overall.

### Fixes
* Fixed Liquid Import progwidget losing any fluid it imported from a fluid block in the world
* Fixed oil generation being allowed in Nether Wastes biome
  * This should have been blacklisted before but was missed; oil should only appear in Basalt Deltas in the Nether by default
  * Config is not retroactively updated; add "minecraft:nether_wastes" to pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> General -> `oil_worldgen_blacklist` if you want to apply this change to an existing world.
* Memory Sticks are now unstackable
* Hopefully fixed problem where Memory Stick XP auto-absorb randomly stopped working
* Fixed higher-tier Mekanism pipes issue when extracting from UV Lightbox

## 2.8.1-96 (19 Dec 2020)

### Updates
* Further performance work on Pressure Tube shape calculation, with more aggressive caching of block shapes
  * Tests indicate a significant reduction in client-side CPU time used for Pressure Tube shape calculation
* Made 3D (in-world) pressure gauge rendering more CPU-friendly

### Fixes
* Fixed client crash on login when Minecolonies is installed
* Fixed toggling of Pneumatic Armor "Core Components" (the master switch) leaving some upgrades in an inconsistent state

## 2.8.0-95 (14 Dec 2020)

### Updates
* Aphorism Tiles have had a major boost in functionality
  * The editor is much more powerful now (supports horizontal cursor positioning, joining/splitting lines & more...)
  * The Aphorism Tile can now display one or more items instead of, or in addition to, text lines
  * Use `{item:<item-id>}`" on a line on its own to show an item, or use the friendly GUI item searcher to add an item
  * The string `{redstone}` anywhere on a line will be substituted with the redstone signal level for the block behind the tile
    * There's also a GUI button to insert this string
  * Tile margin width can be adjusted now, via GUI slider
  * The tile can be now made invisible via GUI checkbox, showing only the text and/or items on the tile
* Elevator pressure mechanics (for stacked elevators specifically) have been reworked
  * All lower Elevator Bases in a stack now have their own air storage, unlike previous versions where they just "proxied" the top elevator in the stack
  * The old system never worked well and was just too bug-prone
  * If you have stacked elevators, you will likely notice a one-time pressure drop after upgrading to this release, due to the extra air storage
  * On the plus side, you now effectively have a bunch of free volume upgrades!  Pressure will drop more slowly as air is used.
  * Also, raised the default elevator max height from 4 blocks per elevator base to 6 blocks per base
    * If you want to take advantage of this in an existing world, edit pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Machines -> `elevator_base_blocks_per_base`
* All fuels (as used by the Liquid Compressors & Kerosene Lamp) are now defined in datapacks as a special recipe type "pneumaticcraft:fuel_quality"
  * This makes it very easy to override existing values or add new custom fuels
  * See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/tree/1.16.4/src/generated/resources/data/pneumaticcraft/recipes/pneumaticcraft_fuels/ for the default fuel JSONs
* Performance improvement for Pressure Tubes: made block shape calculation much more efficient
  * May help with FPS drops in chunks with a lot of tubes, and where a lot of block updates are happening
* Pneumatic Doors now have an "Iron Door" mode in addition to the existing 3 modes
  * Like vanilla Iron Doors, these will *only* open on a redstone signal
* Infinite water source blocks are no longer block-updated when absorbed by Drones/Gas Lifts/Liquid Hoppers
  * This intended primarily for performance (eliminating frequent block updates)
  * Can be disabled in config (pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Advanced -> `dont_update_infinite_water_sources`) if you want to enforce no-infinite-water mechanics in your world
* Area preview has been reworked for several machines:
  * Pressurized Spawner, Security Station, Universal Sensor now have a common "R" GUI button (in bottom right of GUI) to toggle range preview
  * This is now a toggle instead of displaying for a few seconds and disappearing
  * Uses similar preview style (and same code internally) as GPS Tool / GPS Area Tool area previews
  * Air Grate Module also uses this new functionality, but right-click it with empty hand to toggle range preview
* Condition widgets can now record their last measured value in a definable variable
  * Use the Condition widget GUI's to define a "Measure" variable name
  * If defined, the measured value will be stored in that variable each time the condition executes
  * When a measure variable is defined, it's no longer an error to have no branch Text widgets attached to the Condition widget (i.e. the widget can be used purely for measurement, if desired)
* Drones will now no longer travel (fly or teleport) more than 80 blocks to a Charging Station when low on air
  * 80-block limit can be adjusted in config: pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Advanced -> `max_drone_charging_station_search_range`
  * Note that very large limits can in theory make drones teleport thousands of blocks away to someone else's base if your own charging stations are unavailable for any reason
* Some Pneumatic Armor keybinding improvements
  * It's now possible to bind mouse buttons to toggle armor upgrades as well as keyboard keys
  * Fixed integration with vanilla Options -> Controls screen (changing a binding via armor GUI properly reflects in Controls screen and vice versa)
  * Options -> Controls screen divides keybinds into 3 categories: main PneumaticCraft keys, Pneumatic Armor toggles, and Block Tracker submodule toggles
* Made Pneumatic Kick upgrade more effective
  * Increased entity detection area around player's foot a bit (easier to target entities)
  * Reduced air usage somewhat, especially when 4 Dispenser Upgrades installed
  * Increased vertical velocity of kicked target (i.e. better at launching targets into the air!)
  
### Fixes
* Fixed elevator callers not emitting redstone when the elevator is at that floor
* Fixed elevator Charging Upgrades not being sync'd to client (on world reload)
  * This caused client & server to disagree on elevator descent rate, leading to jerky descent
* Fixed drone not being able to fill bottles with water from water source blocks
  * Note that filling water bottles from water tanks is still not possible (with or without a drone) - this is intended behaviour
* Fixed Air Grate entity filter setting (with Advanced PCB installed) not taking effect right away
* Fixed Security Station GUI rendering lines wrongly and eventually starving the client of memory
* Fixed camouflaged Elevators rendering unlit after a neighbour block update
* Fixed Transfer Gadgets not being placeable on a block if a Transfer Gadget already existed on the top face
* Fixed JEI init bug (causing no PNC recipes to show) if `explosion_crafting` is disabled in config
* Fixed Sentry Turret minigun firing sound not playing to clients
* Fixed Charging Station not extracting last tiny bit of air from items when discharging them
  * Related: clean up item NBT when all air has been extracted from an item (don't store air=0 amounts in NBT); mainly for benefit of stacking Air Canisters
* Fixed distance-sorting bug when drone searches for closest Charging Station for recharge
  * This could have caused the drone to fly (or teleport) to an unexpected Charging Station

## 2.7.2-86 (3 Dec 2020)

### Fixes
* Hotfix: avoid infinite recursion crash when Quark is also installed

## 2.7.1-84 (3 Dec 2020)

### Updates
* Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers can now take an Entity Tracker Upgrade
  * This allows them to transfer items and fluids to/from entities in front of the hopper's input or output
  * Tested successfully on: players, Drones, Chest Minecarts and Immersive Engineering's Barrel Minecarts
  * Should work on any entity which provides the appropriate item or fluid capability
  * For players, a horizontally aligned omnihopper will access the equipments slots (armor & offhand), and a vertically aligned omnihopper will access the main inventory
  * Note: this does not apply to vanilla-style absorption of item entities, which continues to work without needing an Entity Tracker Upgrade
* Transfer Gadget input/output mode can now be toggled by right-clicking with an empty hand
  * Logistics Configurator is no longer required, but still works
* TNT fired from an Air Cannon (with Dispenser Upgrade) now has a much longer fuse time, but explodes immediately on impact

### Fixes
* Fix startup crash (missing fluid tags) when Mekanism not installed
* Fixed Vortex Cannon bug making it less effective at breaking grass/crops/leaves etc. than it should be (vortices missing blocks when they should have hit)
* Fixed Transfer Gadgets not rendering properly
  * New entity model and item texture for the Transfer Gadget
* Fixed Transfer Gadgets in input mode pulling from the wrong side of sided inventories such as furnaces
* Fixed spurious error icon for filter showing on Sentry Turret GUI even when the filter is valid

## 2.7.0-83 (30 Nov 2020)

### New
* Added Wall Lamps!
  * These are just simple redstone-activated lamps, in the 16 dye colors
  * Can go on any solid surface, in any of the six orientations (will pop off if their attached block is broken)
  * Also provided inverted versions which go out when a signal is applied

### Updates
* The Jackhammer now takes a Magnet Upgrade, used in the two veinmining modes
  * When installed, all veinmined blocks will be dropped at the position of the block actually broken
  * This has a small extra air cost when used (only when in a veinmining mode)
* You can now quickly cycle the active Jackhammer dig mode with Sneak & Mouse Wheel
* It is now a compile error in the Programmer to use an Area widget with a type other than Box with those widgets which can only use a Box shape
  * These widgets are: Entity Import, Entity Attack, Entity Right Click, Condition: Entity, and Pickup Items
  * These have always required an area type of Box, but previously accepted other area types, silently interpreting as Box type
  * New behaviour is clearer and less misleading
  * Existing already-programmed drones will continue to function as before (it's a compile-time check)
* Programmable Controller now accepts up to 6 Magnet Upgrades to auto-pickup items (same as actual Drones)
* Magnet Upgrade in Drones and Programmable Controllers now only functions when the drone/PC actually has a program to run
* Added client-side config setting "programmer_gui_pauses" to pause the game in SSP when the Programmer is being used
  * Default "false", which is the same as previous behaviour
  * This has no effect in SMP, of course
* Smarter behaviour when using a GPS Area Tool to set a coordinate in the Area progwidget GUI (using the "Inventory Search" button)
  * Now left-clicking the tool selects P1, and right-clicking it selects P2
  * Previous behaviour of just selecting an arbitrary point in the tool's area was not very useful
* Shift-clicking a GPS Area Tool on the background in the Programmer GUI will now create two coordinate widgets, if possible
  * The two coordinates correspond to the P1 and P2 points of the GPS Area Tool
* Fluid tagging changes (mainly around fuels)
  * All fuels are now tagged in the "forge:XXX" namespace for maximum inter-mod compat
  * Immersive Engineering's Ethanol & Plant Oil are equivalent to PNC:R Ethanol & Vegetable Oil, respectively
  * Immersive Petroleum's Crude Oil, Lubricant & Gasoline are equivalent to their PNC:R counterparts
  * API break: `IFuelRegistry.registerFuel()` methods now take a `ITag<Fluid>` rather than a `Fluid`
  * PneumaticCraft "Oil" is now known as "Crude Oil" (translation change only; internal block/fluid ID has not changed)
  * Liquid Compressor GUI: fuels tab now shows the fluid's mod when there are multiple fluids with the same name
* Allow blacklisting of oil worldgen by biome category, in addition to (already existing) biome ID
  * See "oil_world_gen_category_blacklist" in `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`
* Flux Compressor now has an on/off texture on its front face to indicate if it's currently running
* Some performance improvements for the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
  * Less searching of recipe lists required now
* Potatoes, melons and apples can now be used (with Yeast Culture) to make Ethanol in the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
  * Sugar can still be used, and processes faster than it used to
  * Beware: potatoes without Yeast Culture will make Vegetable Oil if the TPP has enough pressure
  * So don't pressurize your TPP if you intend to make Ethanol with it!
* Mekanism Uranium Blocks can now be used as heat sources, same heat properties as Immersive Engineering Uranium Blocks (not very hot, but last for ages)
  * They will eventually turn into Mekanism Lead Blocks
* Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker: "Miscellaneous" setting will now also find Bee Nests
  * Useful to find them in thick forests...
* Amadron changes
  * Added new config setting in `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`: "numVillagerOffers", in addition to the existing "numPeriodicOffers"
  * Periodic trades (from JSON files) are now shuffled into the active Amadron offer list separately from villager trades instead of all being in one big pool
  * This gives server admins more control over how many periodic trades will be shown on each shuffle
  * "numVillagerOffers" and "numPeriodicOffers" set the maximum number of each offer type which can be added when the active trades are shuffled
  * You can set either down to 0, to completely prevent any of that offer type being added
  * Also, "max_trades_per_player" can now be set to 0 (previous minimum 1) to disable player->player trades being added

### Fixes
* Fixed enablement of reach distance upgrade (added in 2.6.2) persisting across world changes in SSP
* Fixed Programmable Controller minidrones "cloning" themselves on the client when leaving and returning to an area
* Programmable Controller state is now properly reinitialized when the programmable item is changed
  * Behaviour is now much more like wrenching and re-deploying a Drone, in that all variable state is reset
* Fixed client NPE when mousing over unconfigured Coordinate progwidget in Programmer GUI
* Fixed pressure text on Pneumatic Helmet HUD wrapping sometimes and looking derpy
  * I couldn't reproduce this myself, but forced a minimum width on the stat widget
* Fixed KubeJS (or indeed any mod which can modify the recipe manager) not being able to remove or modify Amadron offers
* Fixed client crash with Pneumatic Helmet hacking of Jukeboxes
* Amadron GUI cosmetic fixes
  * The search textfield is no longer focused by default, since right-clicking of offers doesn't work when it's
    focused, which is highly unintuitive.  It's still easy to search: press Tab, then type your string.
  * Fixed fluid resources in Amadron offers lacking their tooltip
  * Fixed tooltip overlap on edge of right-hand slot in an offer leading to garbled tooltip

## 2.6.2-73 (20 Nov 2020)

### New
* Placing a Range Upgrade in the Pneumatic Chestplate now gives the player a 3.5-block reach distance upgrade
  * This does not affect melee range, just block interaction
  * There is an associated air cost (5mL/t) while the upgrade is switched on
  
### Updates
* Armor GUI: upgrade button layout in the main armor screen handles low resolutions and/or large scaling better now

### Fixes
* Fixed NPE when breaking Aerial Interface

## 2.6.1-72 (18 Nov 2020)

### Fixes
* Fixed crash with Spawner Extractor on dedicated server
* Fixed a couple of HUD messages with helmet block tracker & mob spawners

## 2.6.0-70 (16 Nov 2020)

### New
* Added a new mob spawning system!
  * This is in addition to the existing (useful but limited) Spawner Agitator
  * New Spawner Core item which can be extracted from vanilla Spawners, or crafted
  * Extract full Spawner Cores from a Spawner with the new Spawner Extractor (be ready for a fight...)
  * Or craft an empty Spawner Core and use the new Vacuum Trap to fill it with mob essence
  * Use a partially or completely filled Spawner Core in the new Pressurized Spawner to spawn mobs
  * Pressurized Spawner uses pressure, can be redstone-controlled, accepts Speed Upgrades...

### Updates 
* The Vacuum Pump is now more efficient at creating a vacuum (more vacuum produced on the "-" side per air consumed on the "+" side) 
* Redstone Mode selection in GUI's has had a makeover
  * There is now one button per mode, rather than a single button to cycle the modes
* Animated stats (i.e. GUI side tabs and the popup HUD boxes for pneumatic armor) have been heavily reworked internally
  * Player-visible changes are fairly limited, but side tabs do wrap their text better now (taking advantage of some vanilla `ITextComponent`/`IReorderingProcessor` code to manage text wrapping & layout)
  * Side tabs don't scale their text now when short of horizontal space, since that never looked good. 
  * Instead, text is always wrapped to fit the available width and a scrollbar added where necessary.
  * Dropped the remaining use of raw `String` in many places, in favour of `ITextComponent`
  * There are API breaks for `IGuiAnimatedStat`, `IHackableBlock` and `IHackableEntity` - sorry!
* The `/dumpNBT` command now requires player permission level 2 (it could be used to inspect item data which should remain secret from regular players)

### Fixes
* Fixed a problem on SMP where players get kicked when they are near other players wearing or holding pressurizable items (tools & armor)
  * I couldn't reproduce this one myself, and I suspect another mod may be interfering, but I've added some defensive coding to cover it

## 2.5.0-66 (5 Nov 2020)
  
### Updates 
* Support for MC 1.16.4, which is very much compatible with MC 1.16.3
  * This release runs on both MC 1.16.3 and 1.16.4
* Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now has "has work" comparator support, like the Refinery
  * When there are valid ingredients in the TPP, and room for output, an attached Comparator will emit a signal of 15
* Pressure tube performance improvement
  * Was unnecessarily computing connections every tick (for leak detection) when it's only necessary to do so on neighbour block updates
* Programmer GUI now warns if multiple Item Filter widgets are attached to an Item Assign widget
* Area widgets in Programmer GUI now show their coordinates and/or variables (when "Show Info" is enabled)
* Drone variable parsing (with `${varname}` syntax): item variables are now supported too
* "Right Click Block" widget is now called just "Right Click" (since it can be used to click both items and blocks)
  * Cosmetic change only, no functional changes

### Fixes
* Fixed a few locale-related errors in recipe deserialization
* Fixed positioning of selected fluid in Fluid Filter GUI
* Fixed drone debugger GUI view not being draggable (like it used to be in 1.12.2)
* Fixed fluid tank displays in JEI recipe pages (e.g. for Speed Upgrades) not showing their contained fluid in the tooltip
* Fixed client crash when trying to open Condition: RF & Drone Condition: RF patchouli pages from the Programmer GUI
* Fixed client crash caused by certain mods trying to pass null world or blockpos data when querying blocks shapes for camouflageable blocks
  * Not a PNC bug as such, but pays to be defensive
  
## Minecraft 1.16.3

## 2.4.5-62 (25 Oct 2020)

### Updates
* Added a new "Void Item" progwidget for drones to use
  * Could be useful for writing quarry programs...
* The `/amadron_deliver` command now requires players to have op level 2 or greater
* Moved Amadron player offers from global config (`config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronPlayerOffers.cfg`) to per-world file (`world/pneumaticcraft/AmadronPlayerOffers.cfg`)
  * Existing player offers in your instance will be automatically moved across, but make a backup of the above file before upgrading if you're concerned
  * This isn't very relevant for single-player worlds since player offers are very much a multiplayer feature

### Fixes
* Fixed server NPE when drones try to place certain unplaceable blocks (e.g. Farmer's Delight rice when there's no water block)
* Fixed dedicated server crash (NoClassDefFoundError) when trying to merge drone programs

## 2.4.4-59 (15 Oct 2020)

### Fixes
* Hotfix: fix init crash which will affect some Java installations (I was wrongly using a library routine not guaranteed to be present at runtime)

## 2.4.3-58 (15 Oct 2020)

### Updates
* Universal Sensor heat sensor can now read the temperature of Heat Frames
  * Also other non-tile entity blocks such as magma, campfires, ice, etc...

### Fixes
* Fixed occasional Aerial Interface crashes on player login when connected to FE cables
* Fix start up crash in certain locales
  * e.g. Turkish, or any other locale where lowercasing a capital letter gives a non-ASCII character
* Fixed server crash caused by Amadrones trying to restock more than 36 stacks of a player offer at once
  * Drone carrying limit is 36 stacks; if more is available for restocking, multiple trips will now be made
* Fixed Volume Upgrades not being taken into account for negative pressures (Vacuum Pump)

## 2.4.2-49 (9 Oct 2020)
 
Releases from 2.4.2 onward *require* Forge 34.1.0 or later.

### Updates
* Mekanism integration has returned!  To recap:
  * Mekanism and PneumaticCraft blocks can exchange heat
    * See `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`, "Integration" section, for some settings on heat exchange properties
  * Mekanism Fuelwood and Resistive Heaters can be used to heat PNC:R machines like the Refinery or Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
  * PNC:R Vortex Tube can be used to heat the Mekanism boiler
  * Heat cables (PNC:R Heat Pipes and Mekanism Thermodynamic Conductors will connect to Mekanism and PNC:R machines, respectively)
  * Mekanism Liquid Ethylene and Liquid Hydrogen can be used as fuels in PNC:R Liquid Compressors
  * Mekanism Configurator can be used to wrench PNC:R blocks
* GUI textfields in various places can now all be right-clicked to clear their current text
* Hopefully improved air particle rendering
* Cyclic XP Juice is now supported in the Aerial Interface

### Fixes
* Fixed Safety Valve tube modules not releasing air when they're supposed to
* Ensure oil lakes configured feature is properly registered (not doing so can cause compat problems with other mods' worldgen)
* Fixed server crash (ConcurrentModificationException) related to Skeleton Horse traps
* Programmer area previewing now disables depth testing (i.e. preview blocks are no longer hidden when in or behind solid blocks)
* Fixed Minigun Ammo and Micromissiles having infinite durability
* Fixed Micromissile tooltips not fully rendering

## 2.4.1-44 (25 Sep 2020)

### Updates
* AE2 Support has returned!  Tested with AE2 8.1.0-alpha.3
  * To summarise: place a Requester Frame on an ME Interface, and tick the "AE2 Integration" checkbox in the AE2 GUI tab
  * Then all items provided via PNC Logistics will appear as "craftable" items in AE2
  * Request crafting of such items to get an available Logistics Drone to fetch those items from PNC Logistics and deposit them into the ME Interface
* Logistics drone behaviour tweaks:
  * If a drone is carrying some resource (item or fluid) that it's unable to drop off, it will now still be able to handle requests for the other resource type
  * Drones will now also ignore minimum order sizes if dropping off a resource they're already carrying (but continue to honour minimum order sizes if it means collecting that resource from a provider frame)
  * Storage and Default Storage frames now also support specifying minimum order sizes
* It's now possible to right-click a Drone (that you own) with an empty fluid tank to drain any stored liquid from its internal tank
  * This may be useful if you end up with a Logistics Drone which can't drop off its fluid (items are dropped when a drone is wrenched, but fluid is not)
* Added some config control over villager trades and house generation (primarily for the use of progression-based modpacks). See the `Villages` section in `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`
  * `addMechanicHouse` (boolean - default true) controls whether Pressure Mechanic houses can appear in villages
  * `mechanicTrades` (NONE, PCB_BLUEPRINT or ALL - default ALL) defines which trades a Pressure Mechanic offers
  * Note that neither setting is retroactive - any already-generated houses and villagers will not be affected by this

### Fixes
* Fixed client crash when rendering fluid textures in GUI's
* Fixed Amadron trade addition GUI bug where trying to open item/search GUIs just returned to the main Amadron GUI
 
## 2.4.0-36 (18 Sep 2020)

The initial 2.4.0 release for MC 1.16.3 release is largely equivalent in functionality to the 2.2.2 release (for MC 1.16.1) with a couple of small worldgen-related changes.

### Updates
* Oil Lake worldgen blacklisting is now done by biome ID instead of dimension ID (see `oil_world_gen_blacklist` in `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`)
* Oil Lakes can now generate in the Basalt Deltas biome in the Nether (but no other Nether biomes)

## Minecraft 1.16.2

*There were no public releases for Minecraft 1.16.2 (would have been PneumaticCraft: Repressurized 2.3.x).*

## Minecraft 1.16.1

The initial 1.16.1 release is largely equivalent in functionality to the 1.4.2 release (for MC 1.15.2), with a few minor player-visible changes.

Releases from 2.1.0 onward *require* Forge 32.0.108 or newer.

## 2.2.2-35 (18 Sep 2020)

## Updates
* All pressurizable tool items are now unstackable (does not apply to drones or air canisters)
* When Alt-clicking an item in the Smart Chest GUI, holding Shift as well will set the slot item limit to the stack's max size instead of the stack's current size

## Fixes
* Fixed drone "Right Click Entity" prog widget not always working (e.g. milking cows with an empty bucket failed)
* Fixed air dupe exploit with stacked pressurizable items and the Charging Module
* Fixed player death message translations

## 2.2.1-32 (14 Sep 2020)

### Fixes
* Fixed Amadrones thinking they had only one inventory slot, causing orders with more than 64 of an item to fail
* Fixed Memory Stick sometimes losing its stored experience
* Left-clicking Memory Stick to toggle XP absorption mode now also works when left-clicking air (previously required a block to be clicked)
* Drone "Inventory Export" widget will now try to keep items stacked in the inventory it's exporting to
  * This also applies to Collector Drones, which use the "Inventory Export" widget internally

## 2.2.0-29 (3 Sep 2020)

Important: if you are also using Immersive Engineering, this release of PNC:R *requires* IE 1.16.1-4.0.0-118 or newer.

### Updates
* Drones (with the Pick up Items widget) will no longer "steal" items off Immersive Engineering conveyor belts
  * Specifically, the widget now honours the "PreventRemoteMovement" entity tag
  * This can be overridden via the widget's GUI when creating the drone program
* A few small cosmetic cleanups and improvements in the Charging Station GUI (including the item upgrade sub-GUI)
  * Upgrade sub-GUI no longer shows armor slots (it's pointless there)
* Reinforced Stone blocks are now a little easier to mine up (blast resistance has not been changed though)
* Sourdough Bread can now be used to make Culinary Construct sandwiches. Yum.
* Overhauled the Drone special variables system a bit:
  * New special variables: `$drone_pos`, `$player_pos`, `$controller_pos`, `$owner_pos`
  * Existing variables `$drone`, `$player` & `$owner` still work but it's recommended to use the new ones
  * Note that `$drone` gets the blockpos *above* the drone (which it always has for historical reasons), but `$drone_pos` gets the drone's real blockpos
  * `$controller_pos` is completely new and gets the Programmable Controller's blockpos, or (0,0,0) if used by an actual drone entity
  * Patchouli manual is updated (see Programming / Variables section) with much more detail.
* Aerial Interface now supports Industrial Foregoing Essence as an XP fluid.
* Waila now shows 2 decimal places of pressure in the focused block, same as The One Probe already does.
* When Charging Station is set to output redstone, frequency of signal changes is now limited to at most once every 10 ticks
  * This should reduce lag caused by rapid output toggling, which can happen when the charged item is at or around the charging threshold
* Thermal Compressor GUI: temperature gauge scales have been tweaked to hopefully show a clearer distinction between hot & cold sides

### Fixes
* Fixed (hopefully) an issue where client-side Logistics Frames would disappear on certain blocks
  * This also caused a client-side crash if right-clicking a "missing" frame with the Logistics Configurator
* Fixed Elevator sometimes entering an air feedback loop, rapidly leading to explosions
* Fixed drone Block Right Click widget sometimes bugging out, leaving the drone repeatedly trying to right-click the same block, even when an area is provided
* Fixed Goto programming widget GUI "Done when departed" and "Done when arrived" meanings being switched.
* Fixed Programmer not showing programming widgets on hi-dpi displays (Macbooks)
* Fixed Pressure Chamber crafting issue where items split across multiple stacks would not get recognised as valid recipe ingredients
* Fixed Liquid Hopper not being able to fill fillable items (buckets, tanks...) dropped in front of the hopper output side.
* Fixed Pneumatic Armor bound keys also triggering when any GUI is open, e.g. typing in a textfield
* Fixed Minigun item being rendered too far right in GUI context
* Fixed Jackhammer item model always rendering with drill bit when not held by player (even when no bit is installed)
* Fixed Pneumatic Wrench opening machine GUIs when rotating blocks in creative mode
* Fixed The One Probe showing a block's current pressure where the max pressure should be shown
* Fixed very long words not being split in GUI side tabs, causing unreadably small text
  * This mainly affects languages such as Chinese, where whitespace is not necessarily used.
* Fixed heat-tintable blocks (e.g. Compressed Iron Block) flashing blue briefly when placed down

## 2.1.1-14 (14 Aug 2020)

### Updates
* Tweaked heat & air output of advanced compressors somewhat
  * All compressors now produce heat proportional to the air produced (adding 1 heat per 20 air/tick produced)
  * This affects the Flux Compressor in particular, which was producing much less heat per air than the Advanced Compressor & Advanced Liquid Compressor
  * Flux Compressor now produces double the heat it used to, so yes: this can be considered a nerf!
  * Heat generation will drop a bit as efficiency drops (since less air is being produced)
  * Fixed issue where fractional amounts of air/tick were getting rounded down (so compressors may produce very slightly more now, depending on circumstances)
* Added Waila/Hwyla support back in
* Drone placement tweak: if Drone is deployed on block with no collision box, deploy the Drone *in* that blockspace instead of the adjacent one

### Fixes
* Fixed Jackhammer being able to break bedrock (and other unbreakable blocks) in area dig modes
* Fixed Drone upgrade crafting recipe not needing a PCB ingredient

## 2.1.0-11 (11 Aug 2020)

### New
* Added a Pneumatic Jackhammer!
  * Powerful and customisable multi-tool which can efficiently break any block
  * Multiple digging modes, selectable via GUI; better modes require a better Drill Bit to be attached
  * Includes two vein miner modes: ores & logs only, and all blocks (requires the top-end Netherite Drill Bit)
  * Upgradable with Speed Upgrades and Volume Upgrades: top speed is extremely fast, but extremely pressure-hungry
  * Can also take a Fortune or Silk Touch enchanted book (swappable on the fly; no enchanting table needed)
  * Documented more in the Patchouli manual (in the "Tools" section)
* Added a Renewables system!
  * Make Biodiesel via a multi-step process requiring the production of Yeast Solution, Ethanol and Vegetable Oil
  * Biodiesel is equivalent to Diesel in fuel quality, and can also be used to make Lubricant and Plastic
  * Some useful by-products & foods are also added:
    * Bandages
    * A way to get double the Speed Upgrades per bucket of Lubricant
    * Sourdough Bread, Chips, Cod & Chips - all good-quality foods
  * All documented in the Patchouli manual in a new "Renewables" section
* Added a new Fluid Mixer machine which can mix two fluids into a new fluid and/or item
  * Used by default for making Biodiesel
  * Can also mix Water & Lava to make Obsidian
  * More recipes can be added via datapacks

### Updates
* Kerosene is now much more efficient in the Kerosene Lamp than other fuels
* Pneumatic Armor HUD now displays only 1 decimal place of pressure for armor pieces
  * This is not just a cosmetic change, but part of an overall performance improvement with pressure sync'ing
  * Previously sync'ing pressures of pneumatic items (including armor) was much too chatty in terms of server->client traffic
  * Now only rounded air levels are sync'd to client, so the client generally knows item pressures with 0.1 bar of precision
  * This is enough for the vast majority of display purposes; e.g. item pressure tooltips already display with 0.1 bar of precision
  * Server->client traffic is now greatly reduced, especially for fast-changing pressures such as Jet Boots
* Added the option to display graphical bars rather than numbers for Armor HUD pressure readouts
  * Select this in main "Core Components" armor GUI - it's also persisted to client config (`show_pressure_numerically`) 
 
### Fixes
* Fixed buggy drone "Right Click Block" behaviour (ported forward from 1.5.2 version)
* Progwidget Item Filter GUI: don't gray out the "Match NBT" checkbox when the filter item has no NBT data
  * Just because it has no NBT data doesn't mean actual instances of the item can't...
* Fixed (worked around) a problem where drones would refuse to pathfind to the space above "tall" blocks
  * "Tall" blocks being fences, walls, gates...
* Fixed drones ignoring installed Inventory Upgrades
* Fixed buggy Heat Frame cooling behaviour (would void some fluid containers such as Mekanism tanks)
* Fixed Logistics Frames not being placeable on the Aerial Interface
* Fixed possible race conditions when registering custom model loaders (pressure chamber glass, minigun, fluid tanks)
  * Now using Forge `ModelRegistryEvent`, hence the 32.0.108 requirement

## 2.0.0-4 (30 Jul 2020)

### Updates
* The Programmable Controller can now optionally charge (with pressure and/or Forge Energy) the "drone's" held item (i.e. the item in inventory slot 0)
  * Added a GUI tab with a checkbox to the controller's GUI to control this.
* The Electrostatic Compressor now needs an Advanced Air Compressor to craft (rather than a basic Air Compressor)
* A few heat-related changes
  * Heat frames now take on their environment's ambient temperature when placed down instead of just using 30C
  * Heat frames will now slowly cool (or warm) back to their ambient temperature when left idle
  * Heat sinks now don't burn the player until they reach 60C (up from 50C).  Burn damage is less at 60C then it used to be, but hotter heat sinks now hurt more to stand in front of.
  * Tintable blocks (Heat Sinks, Compressed Iron Blocks, etc.) now vary their tint much more smoothly as their temperature changes.


### Fixes
* Fixed fluid rendering tile entities not rendering when any GUI is open

## Minecraft 1.15.2

## 1.4.2-58 (29 Jul 2020)

### Updates
* Smart Chest filter slots can now also limit the number of items allowed in a slot
  * Default limit is the size of the itemstack in the slot when filtering is enabled
  * Use Alt + mouse wheel (or Alt + key UP/DOWN) to adjust the limit
    * Hold Shift as well for fast adjustment
  * Existing Smart Chests from previous worlds will use a limit of 64 (or whatever the item's max stack size is) to avoid changing existing behaviour
* Omnidirectional Hopper can now use round-robin when exporting items
  * Default is to try leftmost item first, as before
  * Use button in GUI to toggle to round-robin export
  * Could be useful for example when feeding the player via Aerial Interface for a varied diet
* Aerial Interface in player feed mode now informs the player what they just ate
    
### Fixes
* Fixed NPE when throwing some blocks with chestplate launcher
* Fixed NPE when placing down a new Programmable Controller

## 1.4.1-56 (20 Jul 2020)

### Updates
* Drones can now absorb Experience Orbs
  * Use the Entity Import puzzle piece to do this
  * Added a "@orb" entity filter to whitelist or blacklist XP orbs
  * Imported orbs are auto-converted to Memory Essence fluid and stored in the drone's internal fluid tank
  * Conversion is at the standard rate: 1 XP point = 20mB Memory Essence 
  * Use a Fluid Export puzzle piece to deposit imported Memory Essence into any fluid tank
  * Added config option `drones_can_import_xp_orbs` (default true) to disable this feature entirely if desired
    
### Fixes
* Fixed clientside crash related to minigun tracer rendering with multiple players involved
* Heat Frame fixes: item dupe and loss issues under some circumstances with both cooking and cooling
* Fluid tanks with any fluid will now never stack, even with identical fluid & amount (empty Fluid Tanks will still stack)
* Fixed empty Fluid Tank items being unstackable with other empty tanks after draining in item form (e.g. during heat frame cooling)

## 1.4.0-53 (14 Jul 2020)

### New
* Mekanism integration, still fairly experimental and subject to rebalancing
  * Mekanism and PneumaticCraft blocks will now exchange heat
    * See `config/pneumaticcraft-common.toml`, "Integration" section, for some settings on heat exchange properties
  * Mekanism Fuelwood and Resistive Heaters can be used to heat PNC:R machines like the Refinery or Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
  * PNC:R Vortex Tube can be used to heat the Mekanism boiler
  * Heat cables (PNC:R Heat Pipes and Mekanism Thermodynamic Conductors will connect to Mekanism and PNC:R machines, respectively)
  * Mekanism Liquid Ethylene and Liquid Hydrogen can be used as fuels in PNC:R Liquid Compressors
  * Mekanism Configurator can be used to wrench PNC:R blocks

### Updates
* PNC:R loot items (Stop! Worm, Nuke Virus and Spawner Agitator) should be turning up again in dungeon loot
  * This is still under review to potentially add other PNC:R loot
* More Pneumatic Armor settings (primarily around air usage) are now tunable via mod config
* Jet Boots GUI now offers a throttle control slider bar (default is 100% power)
  * Reducing this might be useful if you have fast jet boots in a tight space, like caves...
* Improved visual appearance of temperature gauges in machine GUI's
* Heat Frame Cooling improvements
  * Making Ice and Obsidian can now be done with tanks (PNC, but also some other modded tanks) containing Water or Lava respectively, not just buckets
  * Made recipes with bonus output a bit more obvious in JEI (spot the big yellow "+" icon!)
  * Recipes taking fluid ingredients now show the ingredient in buckets and in tanks in JEI, for a visual clue
  * Added bonus output for Lava->Obsidian, up to 25% depending on Heat Frame temperature

### Fixes
* Fixed performance issue when world has a large number of entities
  (an event handler was running which scanned all entities every tick, when it only needed to scan a few)
* Fixed bug where upgrades weren't always properly processed in chunkloaded machines
  * Caused machines with volume upgrades to explode on world reload
* Fixed pathfinding bug making Amadrones unable to collect more than two stacks of items
* Fixed keybind handling bug causing modifiers (shift/control/alt) to be ignored in some circumstances
* Fixed buggy Chestplate Launcher behaviour (wrongly consuming the mainhand item)

## 1.3.2-42 (26 Jun 2020)

### Updates
* Block camouflage now properly mimics the complete blockstate recorded on the Camouflage Applicator
  * e.g. for rotatable blocks like Logs, the rotated log is now mimicked, not just the log's default (unrotated) blockstate
* Breaking any machine with redstone settings now preserves those settings (even when broken with a pickaxe)

### Fixes
* Fixed minigun tracers rendering behind other blocks
* Fixed drone block placing (Place widget) not consuming items when block item being placed was not in drone's inventory slot 0
* Fixed NPE with tile entity moving under certain circumstances (see https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/540)
* Fixed Tag Filters in inventories with Requester Frames wrongly counting as requested items

## 1.3.1-39 (22 Jun 2020)
### New
* Immersive Engineering integration has been added back (note: at time of writing, Immersive Engineering is in alpha status on 1.15.2)
  * Harvesting Drones (and Harvest programming widget) recognise Hemp as a harvestable crop
  * External Heater can be used to heat PneumaticCraft blocks (energy usage and efficiency can be adjusted or disabled in PNC config)
  * Immersive Engineering Hammer can be used as a wrench to rotate/drop PneumaticCraft blocks
  * PneumaticCraft Diesel can be used in the IE Diesel Generator, and IE Biodiesel can be used in PNC liquid compressors
    * They are equivalent to each other in fuel quality
  * Pneumatic Chestplate with Security Upgrade installed will protect you from uninsulated wiring damage (at an air cost proportional to the damage prevented)
  * IE Uranium Blocks function as a PneumaticCraft heat source (not very hot, but last a *long* time, eventually turning to Lead Blocks)
  
### Updates
* All sound effects have been converted to mono, since Minecraft doesn't do distance-based attenuation on stereo sounds
  * This fixes the problem of sentry turrets, air leaks, etc. sounding much too loud from a distance
  * Because of this, some default sound volumes have been adjusted upwards in the mod config `pneumaticcraft-client.toml`
  * If you're updating from a previous version (rather than a fresh install) some sounds might seem too quiet; if so, you can review their volume in the above config file on your client
* Universal Sensor work
  * Base range (with no Range Upgrades) has been increased from 2 to 8 blocks
  * ComputerCraft event support - `os.pullEvent('universalSensor')` - should work now 
  * All sensor description texts are now localised, and tidied up
  * GPS Tool icon in the GPS slot is now shaped more like the item
* Sentry Turrets now point the same direction you're facing when you place them (when they're idle, of course)
* Sentry Turret entity filter is now preserved if you break the turret with a wrench (sneak + right-click)
* Safety Valve Modules on basic Pressure Tubes now leak at 4.92 bar instead of 4.9 bar
  * This avoids unwanted leaks if you're pressurising a tier 1 network from a tier 2 network with Regulator Module (4.9 bar)

### Fixes
* Programmer GUI: fixed updates to Coordinate widgets not getting sync'd to server
* All GUI upgrade tabs: the upgrade list is now sorted by upgrade name instead of being completely arbitrary
* Fixed Sentry Turret bullet tracers rendering slightly too low for some targets
* Universal Sensor block is now recognised as a redstone emitter by drone Redstone Condition widget
* Fixed up the Universal Sensor GUI upgrades tab (it was a big mess)
* Players in spectator mode are now ignored by Air Grate Modules and Sentry Turrets
* Fixed Liquid Hoppers not being able to absorb fluid from buckets in front of their input
* Fixed a couple of fluid dupe issues:
  * Tanks may now only be used as crafting ingredients when completely empty (item must have no NBT, so newly-crafted is recommended)
  * Emptying a stack of full tanks into another larger tank would transfer twice the fluid (actually a Forge bug but worked around in PNC)

## 1.3.0-33 (12 Jun 2020)

### Updates
* Logistics Core recipe has been changed to create two cores instead of one
* Some drone pathfinding optimisation, in particular reducing server-side CPU usage when drones can't find a path
  * Added some checks to cull a lot of unnecessary pathing searches
* Small visual improvement for the Omnidirection & Liquid Hopppers
  * Output spout is slightly narrower, and the output end is a little darker
* Pastebin GUI: added "Pretty?" option to control pretty-printing of JSON output to Pastebin/clipboard
  * Default is now *not* to pretty-print JSON, so saved drone programs & remote layouts are a lot more compact
* Redstone Module I/O direction can now be configured in the module's GUI
  * This does not require an Advanced PCB to be installed
  * Toggling I/O with a Wrench still works too, as it used to
* Drones (both entity and item form) now show their carried fluid, if any
  * Shown in item tooltip for drones in item form
  * Shown in TOP/Waila display for drone entities
* It's now possible to attach levers/buttons/etc. to the side of camouflaged blocks (assuming the camouflage is solid, of course)
  * This is particularly nice for camouflaged Pressure Tubes with Redstone Modules
* Elevators with Charging Upgrades installed will now only add air back if it's safe to do so (pressure < 4.9 bar)  
* Some Micromissiles improvements
  * Micromissiles now do more damage on direct entity hit (explosion position was further from the target entity than it should have been) 
  * Micromissiles can now be "repaired" in an Anvil with TNT (1 TNT restores 25 missile shots)
  * Micromissile smoke particles are a bit less dense now
  * Reduced default cooldown time from 15 ticks to 10 ticks (still adjustable in config)
* Some Sentry Turret improvements
  * Default entity filter for newly placed Sentry Turrets is now `@mob` - avoids pain & suffering if players load the turret and forget to set a filter
  * Fixed the entity filter string not showing in GUI the first time it's opened
  * Better filter validation and error display in the GUI
  
### Fixes
* Fixed Charging Stations at 0 bar not being able to discharge pressure from items into the station
* Drones should be able to place blocks much more reliably now
* Fixed Drones (and other entities) sometimes getting badly confused while trying to path across or through some PneumaticCraft blocks
  * Blocks were wrongly reporting themselves suitable for pathing through, when their hitbox actually didn't allow it
* Fixed the clientside `drama_splash` config option not being properly honoured when set to false
* Some Programmer GUI fixes:
  * Fixed widget area dragging behaviour when dragging items from inventory slots across it
  * Fixed Area widgets in the programmer GUI not being sync'd to server when clicked with a GPS (or Area GPS) Tool
  * Fixed Area widgets jumping position when clicked with a GPS or Area GPS tool in the programmer
* Fixed Pastebin communication (now using HTTPS exclusively, looks like HTTP is no longer accepted) 
* Fixed client crash caused by wrongly attempting to send some server->client sync packets
  * Caused sometimes when breaking off camouflage blocks
* Performance fix: Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers were causing some unnecessary block updates when their comparator output level changed 
* Fixed Omnidirectional Hopper comparator output being inaccurate under certain circumstances
* All translation keys are now properly namespaced
  * No player-visible change here but eliminates the risk of translation key clashes with other mods
* Electrostatic Compressor item tooltip is much shorter now (long tooltip still visible in JEI and GUI side tab)

## 1.2.2-30 (1 Jun 2020)

### New
* Added new Thermal Lagging block, an alternative to covering your Refinery & other heat machines with trapdoors
  * Thermal Lagging has no collision box unless sneaking or holding a wrench or pickaxe
  * Makes it easy to "click through" to the machine behind the lagging

### Updates
* Small/Medium/Large tanks now have Comparator support to measure their fullness
* Pressure Mechanic villagers now have some workstation sounds again, as they did in 1.14.4

### Fixes
* Fixed Programmable Controller drones being unable to pick up items or pull items from chests
* Fixed Programmable Controller ignoring its Inventory Upgrades
* Fixed player kick (and subsequent inability to log back in) caused by middle-clicking non-ammo slots in the Minigun magazine GUI
* Fixed minor fluid rendering issues in connected tanks (Small/Medium/Large Tank)
* Fixes to drone pathfinding to hopefully work better with "openable" blocks like trapdoors, doors, etc.
  * Note that drones still can't properly pathfind through doors and trapdoors but this helps interacting with blocks that are covered with trapdoors
* Fixed drones losing all their carried fluid when wrenched to item form
* Fixed Amadrones sometimes dropping their carried items when they suicide
  * Couldn't reproduce this one myself, but added some extra checks to ensure Amadrones never drop anything on death  
* Fixed programmer GUI widget area clipping issues (sometimes not showing any widgets)
  * Most obvious when using the "Auto" GUI scale - this is now much more robust
* Fixed semiblock items (crop sticks, logistics frames etc.) being consumed when placed in creative mode
* Fixed crop sticks allowing multiple sticks to be placed in the same block space

## 1.2.1-25 (25 May 2020)

### Updates
* Made the volume of several sounds configurable in client-side config (pneumaticcraft-client.toml)
  * Miniguns (item, drone & sentry turret)
  * Air leaks (beware of setting this to silent, it helps tracks leaks in your system!)
  * Jet Boots (with separate volume level for builder mode)
  * Elevators
* Regulator Module (without Advanced PCB) now always regulates to 4.9 bar, even when on Advanced Pressure Tubes
  * Was a bit pointless having a Regulator which regulated to 19.9 when the point is to regulate down to tier 1
  * Pressure level is still interpolated from 4.9 down to 0 based on redstone (0 redstone = 4.9 bar, 15 redstone = 0 bar)
  * Regulators with an Advanced PCB are still fully configurable, as always
* Elevators are now much easier to build
  * Elevator Frames are now placed like scaffolding
     * Right-click a frame against another places it on top, building a tower from the bottom
     * Sneak-right-click places it normally (if possible)
  * Elevator Frames will now drop as an item if the block beneath is not an Elevator Base or Elevator Frame
  * Elevator Frames can now only be placed on an Elevator Base or Elevator Frame

### Fixes
* Elevator fixes
  * Fixed client crash when cycling through floors in Elevator GUI (with no Elevator Callers present)
  * Fixed Elevator Frames having a player-blocking hitbox with 3x3 or larger elevators
* Fixed External Program progwidget not doing anything
* Fixed Safety Tube Module not releasing air when it should
* Fixed Regulator Module bug which caused excess pressure to build up in their tube section
* Fixed Refinery Controller block shape (caused x-ray effect with solid adjacent blocks)
* Fixed client crash when trying to camouflage blocks with Pressure Chamber Glass

## 1.2.0-20 (18 May 2020)

### Known Issues
* There is an incompatibility with the version 1.15.2-10m and older of the Performant mod, which (with default settings) will mess up Drone pathfinding
  * Using Performant 1.15.20-11m (not released at time of writing) or newer fixes the problem
  * Alternatively (for older versions), setting `fastPathFinding` to `false` in Performant's config works around the problem

### New
* ComputerCraft support has returned!
  * You will need CC:Tweaked, version 1.88.1 or newer.  Older releases will *not* work.
  * Other than that, it should work pretty much as it did for 1.12.2, although testing has been fairly light so far, so consider this an alpha-level feature.

### Updates
* Pneumatic Armor can now be repaired in an Anvil with Compressed Iron Ingots (and experience)
  * Each ingot repairs 16 durability
  * XP Level cost is (ingots / 2), minimum 1 level
  * This is an addition to using Item Life upgrades, which still work
* Drones with Magnet Upgrade now respect Botania's Solegnolia
* Drones now apply a 40-tick pickup delay to items dropped with the Drop Item widget, same as players do
  * This avoids problems where Drones with Magnet Upgrades just immediately pick up dropped items again
  * The delay can be disabled in the Drop Item widget GUI if you need to
  
### Fixes
* Fixed non-fatal startup exceptions being logged when soft-depended mods (e.g. The One Probe) aren't present 
* Fixed Logistics Drones & Modules not properly handling NBT matching in item filters
* Fixed Aphorism Tile not recalculating the text scale when text adjusted server-side (via drone)
* Fixed GPS Area tool Line and Wall modes sometimes being off by one block (arithmetic rounding error)
* Several GUI fixes and cleanups:
  * Fixed widgets with dropdowns (combo box and color selector) often rendering their dropdown under other widgets
  * Cleaned up the prog widget Area GUI and GPS selection GUI a bit
  * Fixed Programmer widget tray dragging sometimes selecting a widget under the open tray instead of the widget in the tray
  * Fixed fluid searching in the Liquid Filter prog widget GUI

## 1.1.2-14 (May 11 2020)

### Updates
* Oil and Lubricant are now in the `forge:oil` and `forge:lubricant` fluid tags, respectively.
  * This means that (for example) Silent Mechanisms Oil (also tagged as `forge:oil`) is now accepted in the Refinery by default.
* Disabled Redstone particle emission for pressure tube modules
  * This was unreliable and fixing it properly would involve a lot more packet syncing from server to client which is not really worth it
  * Waila/TOP still shows the output level

### Fixes
* Fixed infinite air exploit with Thermal Compressor
  * Thermal Compressor handles heat -> air conversion differently now since there was the possibility of a feedback loop in conjunction with a Vortex Tube
  * Increased heat capacity of several heat source blocks (such as magma) to compensate.
  * It's technically still possible to generate "free" air with sufficiently complex setups, but the amount generated is very small and not really worth the effort (it would be very difficult to do any useful work with it). This is a necessary compromise between having an exploitable system and making the Thermal Compressor so weak that it's useless.
* Fixed server crash with UV Light Box (related to a drone flying nearby and playing particle effects)
* Fixed some bugginess in Pressure Tubes connecting and disconnecting or wrongly leaking
* Fixed Small Tanks not getting used up in crafting recipes
* Fixed Logistics Module not rendering properly
* Fixed Pressure Chamber crafting bug where 2 milk buckets made slime balls (correct recipe is 1 milk bucket + 4 green dye = 1 bucket + 4 slime balls)
* Fixed Heat Frame Cooling not working on dedicated server
* Fixed Flux Compressor GUI not offering a "Low Signal" redstone mode
* Fixed Charging Module over-aggressively caching an item handler capability (was most apparent with Aerial Interface not reliably working with side switching and the Charging Module)
* Fixed crashes when adding Amadron player-player trades
* Fixed Amadron not matching items with NBT even when the item in the offer has no NBT
  * E.g. Quark adds some NBT to the vanilla Compass, which is a villager Amadron can offer sometimes. With the added NBT, any Compasses players held were untradeable.

## 1.1.1-6 (May 5 2020)

### Updates

* Added/updated some item/block tags
  * `pneumaticcraft:plastic_sheets` contains `pneumaticcraft:plastic`
  * `minecraft:stone_bricks` includes `pneumaticcraft:reinforced_stone_bricks`
  * `forge:stone` includes `pneumaticcraft:reinforced_stone`
* All crafting recipes using compressed iron now use the tag `forge:ingots/compressed_iron` rather than the compressed iron item
  * Note that Silent Mechanisms also provides compressed iron using this tag, so you can use that mod's compressed iron too. 
  * This is fine with me since Silents compressed iron is probably more effort to make than PNC:R's.
* All Refinery and TPP recipes now use fluid tags rather than the fluid directly.  
  * All PNC:R fluids have a corresponding fluid tag now (e.g. `pneumaticcraft:diesel` tag contains `pneumaticcraft:diesel` fluid by default and so on)
  * This makes it a lot easier to support other mods' fluids with default recipes - just add them to the appropriate `pneumaticcraft:` fluid tag
* Entity filters now support a couple of new matches for sheep, wolves & cats
  * `sheep(shearable=yes)` matches only sheep which have wool right now (good if you want to give your shearing drone a break)
  * `sheep(color=XXX)` matches only sheep of a given color (colors are e.g. "white", "black", "light_blue"...)
  * `wolf(color=XXX)` and `cat(color=XXX)` match only wolves/cats with a given collar color, just in case you feel the need to sort your pets by collar color

### Fixes

* Fixed Refinery GUI not showing output fluids
* Fixed Amadron recipe scanning barfing if recipe JSON's are missing `type` field; such recipes are now quietly ignored
* Fixed server crash if no valid villager professions are found when looking for villager trades to add to Amadron (this should only happen if a previous datapack loading error occurred, like the missing `type` field error above)
* Removed reference to non-existent plastic mixer from the Patchouli guidebook which was causing some log spam about missing items

## 1.1.0-3 (May 3 2020)

This release adds no major new features to the 1.14.4 version, but there are several smaller changes & fixes worth noting.  See 1.14.4 changes below for major changes relative to 1.12.2, and also https://gist.github.com/desht/b604bd670f7f718bb4e6f20ff53893e2

### Updates
* Security Station hacking has been disabled for now; it needs a reimplementation.
  * The Security Station still works to protect areas but currently can't be hacked.
* Recipes
  * All machine recipes are now handled through the vanilla recipe system, and loaded from `data/<modid>/recipes/<machine-type>/*.json`. 
  * The most player-visible effect of this is that machine recipes now show up properly in JEI on dedicated servers.
* Amadron changes
  * Builtin Amadron offers are now loaded as vanilla recipes from `data/<modid>/recipes/amadron/*.json`.  Note that villager trades and player-player offers are still handled separately.
  * JEI now shows *only* the Amadron offers which have been loaded from datapack.  Periodic villager trades and player-player offers require an Amadron tablet to view.
* Smelting Plastic Construction Bricks to Plastic Sheets no longer provides any experience.
* Reduced vertical aggro range of Guard Drone to 8 up & 5 down, to minimise risk of aggroing something in a cave deep below and teleporting off, leaving owner puzzled as to where it went.  Horizontal range is unchanged at 16 in each direction.
* Logistics advancements no longer require plastic to be unlocked (since logistics items no longer require plastic...)
* Drones no longer use their owner's UUID for their fake player.
  * While this was convenient for protection mods, it introduced some subtle problems, where the server associated a player's UUID with a fake player object instead of the real player.  The most obvious effect of this was advancements often not working.
  * Protection mods should now use "{playername}_drone" to permit a given player's drones.
* Improved textures for Air Cannon, Vacuum Pump & Charging Station.  Also, these machines now use Reinforced Stone Slabs instead of Cobblestone or Stone slabs in their crafting recipes.
* Reduced network chatter for leaking pressure tubes (sounds and particles now played purely client-side)
* Reduce network chatter for moving elevators
* Reduced Air Grate air usage; it now only uses air when actively pushing/pulling entities
* Botania support added back
  * Solegnolia blocks the Pneumatic Chestplate Magnet upgrade
  * Paint lens will now dye Plastic Construction Blocks
  * Blaze Block now act as heat sources (turn to glowstone on excess heat extraction)
* Programmable Controller now accepts Forge energy (up to 100,000FE)
  * Allows it to use Import/Export RF programming widgets properly
* Sheep can now be hacked (randomise their wool colour)
* Pneumatic machines and tubes now occasionally creak if over-pressure and air is added
* Vortex tube now has permanent red & blue bands at either end to make it clear which is the hot side and which is the cold side
* Pressure gauge module now only renders when player is within 16 blocks
* Pressure interface doors render better, especially when beside Pressure Glass (doors now no longer stick out the side when open)
* Jet Boots speed slightly increased, back to 1.12.2 levels (was a little slower in 1.14.4 version due to an error on my part)
* Fixed multiblock elevators playing their sound effects much too loud.
* JEI now shows all "special" crafting recipes: gun ammo + potion crafting, drone dyeing, drone upgrading, guidebook crafting and pneumatic helmet + one probe crafting.

## Minecraft 1.14.4

This release brings a very major internal rewrite and many many major new and modified gameplay elements. See also https://gist.github.com/desht/b604bd670f7f718bb4e6f20ff53893e2

## 1.0.1-10 (Apr 17 2020)
### Fixes
* Fixed Block Tracker behaviour (performance and crashes) with Hackables
* Also, Block Tracker now picks up blocks added by block tag (doors & buttons)
* Fixed client crash (NoSuchMethodError) when pressing Return (insert line) in an Aphorism Tile gui, when on dedicated server
* Fixed Elevator not always rendering when extended
* Fixed Gas Lift: block model now only shows tube connectors where connected, and GUI now shows fluid in the tank
* Fixed Air Cannon not being able to fling entities when Entity Tracker upgrade is installed
* Refinery Output block now has the right block shape

## 1.0.0-8 (Mar 22)

### Known issues
* On dedicated server, JEI may not show custom machine recipes when you log in. 
  * If this happens, a "F3+T" asset reload will fix the problem.
  * A timing issue as far as I can tell (JEI processes recipes before the client gets custom recipes from the server); don't have a fix for it yet.
* JEI currently doesn't show recipes for a few special crafting operations (but the recipes themselves should work fine):
  * Drone colouring (drone + dye)
  * One Probe helmet (Pneumatic Helmet & Probe)
  * Minigun potion ammo (regular ammo + any potion)
  * Crafting Patchouli guide (book + compressed iron ingot)
  * Drone upgrade crafting (any basic drone + Printed Circuit Board)
* Mouse-wheel scrolling GUI side tabs with scrollbars doesn't work if JEI is active and has icons on that side of the GUI
  * Mousing over the scrollbar itself and scrolling should work
  * JEI issue 

### New
#### Recipes
* Recipes in general use a lot less iron, especially in the early game.  However, more stone will be required (so it's worth smelting up a stack or two of cobblestone before you start on the mod).
  * Added a collection of Reinforced Stone blocks (bricks, slabs, pillars, walls...), made with stone and (a little) Compressed Iron.  
    * These are both good for building with (high blast resistance), and are used in many recipes to reduce compressed iron requirements.
* For modpack makers: all machine recipes are now loaded from datapacks (`data/<modid>/pneumaticcraft/machine_recipes/<machine_type/*.json`) so can be easily overridden and reloaded on the fly with the `/reload` command.  To remove an existing recipe, simply create a JSON file of the same name in your datapack with an empty JSON document: `{}`
  * You can see all default recipes at https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/tree/1.14/src/main/resources/data/pneumaticcraft/pneumaticcraft/machine_recipes
#### Machines
* Pressure Chamber
  * The unloved Pressure Chamber Interface filter system is gone.  The Interface will now only pull crafted items (there is a button in the Interface GUI to pull everything in case the chamber needs to be emptied).
  * The Pressure Chamber Interface also accepts a Dispenser Upgrade; if installed it will eject items into the world if there is no adjacent inventory.  (Note that the interface still auto-pushes items; no need to pull items from it).
  * Several new default recipes, including ways to make slime balls, ice, packed ice, and blue ice
* Refinery
  * There is now a separate Refinery Controller block in addition to the four Refinery Outputs
  * Refinery Outputs can be stacked beside or on top of the Refinery Controller
  * Outputs only output fluid, never accept it (except from the Controller)
  * Controller only accepts input fluid (Oil by default)
* Thermopneumatic Processing Plant
  * Can now take recipes which produce an item output in addition to or instead of a fluid output
    * One such recipe is added by default: an Upgrade Matrix taking Lapis and Water, which is used to craft upgrades in a more lapis-efficient way
* Etching Tank
  * This is a new machine which replaces the old in-world crafting of PCB's with Etching Acid
  * It's faster than the old method of etching PCB's (twice as fast by default, much faster if the tank is heated)
  * With sufficient infrastructure, this can be even faster than using the Assembly System to mass-produce PCB's (but the Assembly System remains a simpler & more convenient option)
  * Separate output slots for succesful and failed PCB's; failed PCB's can be recycled in a Blast Furnace (which also yields a little XP)
* UV Light Box
  * The GUI now has a slider to set the exposure threshold instead of using redstone emission
  * Exposed items (past the configured threshold) are moved to a new output slot, which can be extracted from using automation
* Programmer improvements
  * Fix inconsistent zoom out/zoom in behaviour
  * Now possible to merge programs from Pastebin, clipboard or saved items
* Gas Lift
  * Now uses new Drill Pipe block instead of Pressure Tube
  * Drill Pipe is a non-tile entity block so it's also suitable for decorative building
#### Plastic
* Coloured plastic is gone, and so has the Plastic Mixer.
  * There is now only one type of plastic: the Plastic Sheet.
    * Which also means there's only one type of Programing Puzzle Piece, making Drone programming a lot easier.
  * You can make Plastic Sheets by pouring a bucket of Molten Plastic (made in the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant from LPG & Coal as before) into the world.  It will solidify after 10 ticks.
  * Alternatively, put a bucket (or tank) of Molten Plastic in an inventory with a Heat Frame attached, and chill the Heat Frame as much as possible (-75C is optimum) for bonus Plastic Sheet output; up to 1.75x.
  * New Plastic Construction Brick™, made from plastic and any dye. Can be used for building; they also damage any entity that steps on them without footwear.
#### Semiblocks 
* Semiblocks are now entities. No direct gameplay effect, but rendering and syncing of semiblocks should be far more robust now.
  * Semiblocks include crop supports, logistics frames, heat frame, spawner agitators and transfer gadgets.
#### Storage
* Added Reinforced Chest - a 36-slot, blast-proof inventory which keeps its contents when broken
* Added Smart Chest - a 72-slot blast-proof inventory which keeps its contents when broken
  * Smart Chest can also filter each slot to only hold a certain item
  * And close one or more slots, effectively giving the chest a configurable inventory size
  * *And* push and pull items to adjacent inventories
  * *AND* eject items like a dropper and absorb nearby items like a vacuum hopper
  * Super powerful, but not the cheapest to make (needs a PCB)
* Added three new fluid storage tanks, imaginatively title the Small Fluid Tank (32000mB), Medium Fluid Tank (64000mB) and Large Fluid Tank (128000mB)
  * Denser storage than the Liquid Hopper
  * Can be stacked vertically, and combined (with a wrench) into a sort-of-multiblock
  * Has a GUI where items can be inserted to transfer fluid, e.g. buckets, liquid hoppers, memory sticks (see below)
#### Items & tools
* Camo applicator right-click behaviour changed a little
  * Right click any non-camo block to copy its appearance
  * Sneak right click to clear camo
  * Right click any camo block to apply (or remove) camo
* Vortex Cannon
  * Reduced air usage by half
  * Increased crop/leaves breaking range from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5
  * Can now also break webs (very efficiently)
* Memory Stick (new)
  * Can be used to store and retrieve experience
  * Added a new Memory Essence fluid which is liquid experience (20mB = 1 XP point)
  * Memory Essence can be extracted from a Memory Stick via Liquid Hopper or any machine that can pull fluid from an item (e.g. the new tanks mentioned above)
  * Memory Stick will go in a Curio slot
  * Memory Essence is supported by the Aerial Interface
* Minigun
  * Freezing Ammo now creates a cloud (like a potion cloud) instead of "ice" blocks.  The cloud will freeze and damage entities in it.
#### Heat System
* Added new Heat Pipe block, perfect for transferring heat from one place to another.
  * Heat Pipe loses no heat to adjacent air or fluid blocks.  Consider it a much more compact alternative to lines of Compressed Iron Blocks surrounded by insulating blocks.
  * Heat Pipe can be camouflaged to run through walls/floors, and is waterloggable.
* Heat Frame Cooling expanded a little
  * Fluids to be cooled can now be provided with tanks, not just buckets (assuming the tank item provides a fluid handler capability)
  * Recipes can have a bonus output based on the temperature (new Molten Plastic -> Plastic Sheet recipe does this, but the old lava->obsidian and water->ice recipes do not)
* Campfire is recognised as a heat source, and is better than lighting a fire on netherrack.
#### Amadron
* Significant internal rewrite to hopefully fix the various syncing problems encountered in 1.12.2.
* Villager trades work much as before, but with support for trade levels: higher level trades will appear much more rarely in the random offers list.
* Player->player trades are still added via the tablet GUI, and are stored in `config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronPlayerOffers.cfg`.
* All static Amadron trades are now loaded from datapacks (`data/<modid>/pneumaticcraft/amadron_offers`) so are much easier to modify or disable.  Because of this, adding static/periodic trades via the tablet GUI is no longer a thing.
  * See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/tree/1.14/src/main/resources/data/pneumaticcraft/pneumaticcraft/amadron_offers for the default offers
  * Default offers can be disabled by simply using an empty JSON document `{}`.
#### Villagers
* You might get lucky and find a Pneumatic Villager house when exploring (there are different houses for each of the five village biomes)
  * These houses have a couple of basic PneumaticCraft tools and machines, and a chest with some handy loot
* The Pneumatic Villager (Mechanic) has a massively expanded trade list, with some nice trades at higher levels
  * Villager point-of-interest is the Charging Station, so unemployed villagers can become Mechanics
  * Because of this, the old way of creating mechanics in the pressure chamber no longer works
#### Drones
* Added two new basic (non-programmable) drones:
  * Guard Drone: attacks any mobs in a 31x31x31 area around where it's deployed
  * Collector Drone: collects nearby items (17x17x17) and puts them in an inventory that it's deployed on or adjacent to. Has some basic item filtering functionality. Can take range upgrades to expand the item collection range.
#### Logistics
* Added the ability to filter by mod ID
* Added support for the Tag Filter item, a way to filter by item tags (the replacement for ore dictionary matching)
  * Use a Tag Workbench (new block) to create Tag Filters
* Reduced the amount of air used to transport items & fluids, and made the amount adjustable in config (see "Logistics" section in `pneumaticcraft-common.toml`)
#### Upgrades
* Max upgrade amounts are now hard-enforced in machine & item GUIs
  * e.g. if a machine takes a max of 10 Speed Upgrades, it is now impossible to put more than 10 Speed Upgrades in the machine (unlike in 1.12.2 where any number could be added but only 10 were used).
* Volume upgrades have changed a bit
  * Max volume upgrades in anything is 25.
  * They have diminishing returns as more added: 1 upgrade will double the base volume, 4 upgrades will quadruple it, 25 upgrades will increase the volume by a factor of 10.
* New upgrades:
  * Jumping Upgrade - replaces Range Upgrade in Pneumatic Leggings
  * Inventory Upgrade - replaces Dispenser Upgrade in Drones
  * Flippers Upgrade - for Pneumatic Boots, swim speed increase
  * Standby Upgrade - for Logistics & Harvesting drones; allows them to go on standby when idle, saving air
  * Minigun Upgrade - replaces Entity Tracker Upgrade in drones  
* Some upgrades are now *tiered*, meaning there is a different crafting recipe for each tier. 
  * Jet Boots Upgrade and Jumping Upgrade are examples of such upgrades.
#### Tube Modules
* Regulator Module now by default regulates to 0.1 bar below tube pressure (4.9 for basic tubes, 19.9 for advanced tubes)
  * A full redstone signal will reduce the regulation amount to 0 (acting like a shut-off valve), intermediate signal levels interpolate the regulation level
  * With an Advanced PCB installed, fine-grained control is available as it used to be
* Safety Valve Module now leaks air at 0.1 bar below tube pressure (4.9 for basic tubes, 19.9 for advanced tubes)
  * Again, adding an Advanced PCB allows fine-grained control, as it used to
* Redstone Module will now take input from a Pressure Gauge module on the same tube section
* Tubes with inline modules (the Regulator and Flow Detector) can *only* be connected to on the two ends of the module
  * no more connecting to a Regulator module on the side (which never worked properly anyway) 
#### Misc
* Added a Display Table, a simple one-item inventory which displays its held item. For both aesthetic and possible automation purposes.
* Fuels now have a burn rate multiplier in addition to a "total air produced" amount
  * Diesel burns more slowly now, but produces slightly more air overall
  * LPG burns a little faster, same overall production
  * Gasoline burns significantly faster, same overall production
  * Kerosene is unchanged
* Kerosene Lamp uses much less fuel now, especially at larger ranges
* Lots of general GUI cleanup and polishing
* Updated textures for many items
* Fluid-containing items (Liquid Hopper, tanks, machines...) now show their contained fluid while in item form
* Pressure Tubes are now waterloggable
#### Mod Integration
* Currently patchy compared with 1.12.2, but the following mods are currently supported:
  * The One Probe
  * WAILA/HWYLA
  * JEI
  * Patchouli (the guide book has been updated to reflect all the new changes)
  * Curios
* More mod support will be added in future, but this is not likely to happen until the 1.15.2 port.
