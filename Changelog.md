# PneumaticCraft: Repressurized - Changelog

This is an overview of significant new features and fixes by release.  See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master for a detailed list of all changes.

Changes are in reverse chronological order; newest changes at the top.

## Minecraft 1.12.2

### 0.9.0-??? (unreleased)
#### New
* Major Minigun enhancements!
  * Minigun now has a 4-slot inventory for ammo, saving valuable player inventory slots.  The Minigun will only draw ammo from these slots.
  * Sneak & Right-Click the Minigun to open the inventory and load ammo
  * Ammo slots can be "locked" by middle-clicking a slot; when a slot is locked, the Minigun will *only* pull ammo from that slot.  Useful when multiple ammo types are loaded.
  * Added several new ammo types:
    * Armor-Piercing: higher base damage, ignores armor, 250 shots per cartridge
    * Incendiary: sets fire to targets, 500 shots per cartridge
    * Freezing: slows targets, has chance to encase in damaging "ice", 500 shots per cartridge
    * Weighted: very short range, high damage, 250 shots per cartridge
    * Explosive: shots have chance to cause explosions (terrain damage off by default), 125 shots per cartridge
    * Plain ammo remains as before, and is the only ammo type which can be potion-tipped
  * Minigun can now take upgrades (use a Charging Station to install):
    * Speed Upgrades: reduces spin-up time, chance to fire multiple rounds per shot, increased air usage
    * Range Upgrades: increase range from 50 blocks to up to 80 blocks (5 blocks per upgrade), increased air usage
    * Entity Tracker Upgrades: zooms in while firing
    * Dispenser Upgrades: increase chance of all ammo types (including regular ammo with potions) proc'ing their effect, greatly increased air usage
    * Item Life Upgrades: slowly replenish ammo when gun is in inventory for significant air usage
    * Security Upgrade: prevent damage to pets and players
* Added Micromissiles: hand-held missile pods which can fire guided missiles with an explosive payload
  * 100 missiles per pod (by default; configurable)
  * Can configure missiles to balance between top speed, turn speed and damage
  * Missiles will lock onto to nearest valid target; can filter targets with entity filters as used in other PneumaticCraft blocks & items
  * Dumb-fire mode where missiles just fly in a straight line; slower but higher damage
  * Missiles have a configurable launch cooldown (20 ticks by default)
* Pneumatic Chestplate now takes up to 4 Dispenser upgrades to enable an item launcher:
  * Press & release the launch hotkey (default: Control + C) to charge the launcher and fire items/blocks
  * Full charge takes 15 ticks
  * Some items (arrows, eggs, TNT...) have special behaviour, similar to how a dispenser would operate
  * Other items will be simply fired as item entities
  * Other blocks will be fired as "tumbling block" entities, which try to reform as a block on contact with any other block. This allows torch launching functionality and other remote block placing, for example.
#### Updates
* Camo Applicator now shows particle effects when applying/removing camo from a block
* Entity Filter strings can now be prefixed with a "!" to negate the check (e.g. "!zombie" means "anything except zombies")
* Entity Filter handling is now a bit more efficient in general (pre-parsing the filter string wherever possible, so less string processing)
* In Programmer GUI, when the widget tray is open, middle-click can now also be used to open IGW docs for puzzle pieces (pressing 'I' still works, but the filter field has focus when the tray is open so mouse is more convenient)
#### Fixes
* Fixed Minigun Drone sync issue: minigun not orienting toward targets and not display bullet traces when firing
* Fixed problem where players sometimes take damage from jumping with Pneumatic Leggings + Range Upgrade (any fall damage from such a jump is supposed to be cancelled)
* Fixed Pneumatic Door dropping an item when breaking top half in creative mode
* Fixed messy block break particles when breaking a Pneumatic Door in survival mode
* Fixed crash when Pneumatic Door rotation is messed up (by other mods' rotation code)

### 0.8.4-303 (25 Nov 2018)
#### Updates
* The Kerosene Lamp can now hold 2000mB of fuel (up from 1000mb). This makes it practical to use fuel buckets to automatically fuel it (because the lamp reduces its lighting and fuel consumption when very low on fuel, it would previously run for ages on low lighting before exhausting its fuel supply and accepting a new bucket).
* Pneumatic Helmet Entity Tracker mob targeting warnings are now all handled server-side, reducing network traffic requirements and also resolving a client-side crash with certain modded entities (Ice & Fire Gorgons in particular, but potentially others).
* Restored some pre-0.8.0 functionality: the Aerial Interface once again allows access to the player's armor via the top face even when a Dispenser Upgrade is installed (but only when the top face is connected to armor). This was technically an unintended quirk, but some players were using it.
* Improved server-side performance of the Assembly Controller (smarter about discovering its machines), and made client-side GUI diagnostic messages more informative regarding duplicate and/or missing machines.
* Logistics Modules are now much cheaper to use in terms of air cost, especially for moving fluids:
  * The air cost now increases linearly with distance instead of quadratically.
  * The overall multiplier cost for items and fluids has also been halved.
  * Example: moving 8000mB of fluid a distance of 20 blocks now costs 8000mL of air, instead of an impossible 320000mL.
  * When there isn't enough air available in the tube to move the entire requested amount of items or fluid, the module will now move what it can instead of giving up and doing nothing. This makes Logistics Modules far more capable of moving resources over longer distances.
* Drone debug messages (accessed with Pneumatic Helmet + Entity Tracker & Dispenser Upgrades) now show elapsed time since last message of that type rather than the number of messages of that type, which wasn't too useful (and could also use a lot more memory than necessary in some situations).
* Drone Place Block program piece will now overwrite replaceable blocks such as tall grass & snow layers.
* Reduced Elevator sound volume depending on the number of individual elevators in a multiblock collection (each elevator plays the sound, so multiple elevators together can be quite loud).
* Drones can now pick up & drop Minecarts and Boats (including any passengers and/or contents) using Entity Import/Export programming pieces.
* In entity filters, "@boat" now matches boat entities.
* In entity filters, "@mob" now matches any hostile entity, including Slimes and Shulkers (which were previously not included).
* Added a new "Match by Block" checkbox to the Item Filter GUI in the Programmer, which is only used by the "Dig" programming piece. This allows Drones to match blocks which never drop an item, such as Abyssalcraft's Shoggoth Ooze. So you can get your Drones to clean up that nasty stuff now.
#### Fixes
* Fixed a long-standing but rather subtle bug where Advanced Pressure Tubes only had 1000mL air volume following a world reload instead of the 4000mL they should have had.  More details:
  * Advanced Pressure Tubes are supposed to have a 4000mL volume, and they do when initially placed down. However due to a bug, upon reloading the world, their volume reverts to 1000mL (same as a basic Pressure Tube).
  * This changes resolves that problem for new Advanced Pressure Tubes placed from now on.
  * However, any pre-existing Advanced Pressure Tubes will need to be broken and replaced if you want to take advantage of their correct air volume.
  * This isn't essential and you can replace tubes at your leisure. You will have improved air storage in your tube network once your tubes have re-pressurized.
  * If you're using Logistics Modules, you will probably see the greatest benefit, since the newly fixed tubes are much more effective in moving items and fluids around due to their greater air storage.
* Fixed Vortex Cannon not always breaking plants/leaves/etc. even though the fired vortex appears to make contact.
* Fixed Vortex Cannon re-equip animation constantly being played if the held cannon is being charged from Pneumatic Chestplate or Aerial Interface.
* Fixed client crash when selecting area type in Area GPS Tool.
* Fixed client crash when selecting uninitialized GPS Tools in the GUI Inventory Search window.
* Fixed Elevators playing a spurious "elevator stop" sound to any players who log in nearby, even when the Elevator is idle.
### 0.8.3-299 (5 Nov 2018)
#### Updates
* Elevator Base now accepts up to 4 Charging Upgrades.  Each Charging Upgrade allows the elevator to reclaim some of the air spent to raise the elevator when the elevator descends again, up to a max of 60% of the air (15% per upgrade). This comes with the penalty of slower elevator descent (10% slower per upgrade).
* GUI side tabs now have a more visually appealing beveled border instead of a hard black border.  If you prefer the old appearance, set the 'B:guiBevel' clientside option to false in pneumaticcraft.cfg.
* Aerial Interface has a new informational GUI side tab making it clear whether it's currently interfacing items or food/xp.
* Aerial Interface RF charging is now significantly more efficient on server CPU.  Note however that it may take a couple of seconds to start charging items that have been newly added to your inventory, or have been moved in your inventory.
* Air Grate Module improvements:
  * Now works on entity eye position, not feet position.  If you can see it, it can see you...
  * Range display box now accurately shows the range.  It will appear for ~6 seconds when the module's range changes due to a pressure change.
  * The Module now plays occasional air particles towards entities that it's affecting.
* Added config setting 'B:liquidHopperDispenser' to control whether the Liquid Hopper accepts a Dispenser Upgrade to pull or push fluids from/to the world.  Default is true.
#### Fixes
* Fixed client crash when opening Amadron GUI, introduced in 0.8.2.
* Fixed server crash in conjunction with Quark when a Drone breaks a tool/weapon (Quark auto item restock wasn't agreeing with the Drone's fakeplayer inventory).
* Fixed some text information being omitted from GUI Redstone side tabs.
* Fixed greater-than/less-than threshold not being toggleable in Pressure Gauge GUI (with Advanced PCB installed).
* Fixed problem with Aerial Interface sometimes showing the same XP fluid types more than once in the XP GUI side tab.
* Fixed visual artifacts when rendering Forge Energy bars in GUI's (Aerial Interface, Flux Compressor...)
* Fixed Omnidirectional Hopper failing to pull from some machines (noticed with Gregtech machines)
* Fixed player sometimes being left standing on top of an elevator frame and not being "collected" by a descending elevator platform.
* Fixed Pressure Chamber Interface allowing items to be piped in/out without checking that the corresponding door was fully open.

### 0.8.2-288 (30 Oct 2018)
#### New
* Added a SCUBA Upgrade for the Pneumatic Helmet for underwater breathing and better underwater vision. It's an alternative to using the Aerial Interface, which still works; the Aerial Interface is more efficient in terms of air usage, but doesn't provide the clear vision (best option is of course to use both!)
* Added a Night Vision Upgrade for the Pneumatic Helmet. No prizes for guessing what that does.
* Added armor GUI controls for Pneumatic Leggings speed and jump upgrades, to allow the boost magnitude to be throttled back (0-100%). Useful if you want to e.g. reduce your jump height without needing to find a Charging Station to swap out upgrades from your armor.
* Electrostatic Compressor has been heavily reworked:
  * No longer triggered by real lightning strikes. This was much too open to abuse via any other mod which can spawn a lightning entity (e.g. Psi)
  * Instead, each compressor now has a chance to cause a fake lightning entity random with a 6-block circular radius of itself
  * Iron bars grid are still important - the fake lightning bolt must strike a connected grid to be effective. Although the bars must be connected, they may be up to 5 blocks above or 5 blocks below the compressor.
  * Strike chance is very low in clear weather, better in the rain, and much better in a thunderstorm
  * Strike chance can be slightly improved by adding a lightning rod: a vertical column of iron bars up to 8 blocks directly above the compressor
  * Multiple compressors can be connected to the same grid: generated pressure will be shared, as before.
  * Chiseled Iron Bars are now also recognised as valid iron bars
* Added buttons to Air Cannon GUI allowing the force to be throttled between 0% and 100%.  Allows finer control over the cannon's range than just adding Range Upgrades.  The Air Cannon will now also aim lower if it can.
* New fancier particle effects for air rendering (air leaks, pressure chamber, jet boots...)
* Heat mechanics update: it is no longer possible to repeatedly break and replace a heat source block to stop it converting to stone/obsidian. That has always been considered an exploit. Using heat source blocks (lava/magma/pyrotheum...) is still a valid approach, but you will need to supply new materials to replaced the cooled ones.
#### Updates
* Default thermal resistance for all fluids is now 500.  Previously this only applied to flowing Lava and Water (all other fluids including static lava and water had a resistance of only 10).  This means that Lava (and fluids such as Blazing Pyrotheum) is now a more effective heat source for blocks like the Refinery since they won't solidify almost immediately. This may not work for existing worlds; in this case, you can set D:fluidThermalResistance=500.0 in pneumaticcraft.cfg.
* The maximum number of Speed Upgrades in the Pneumatic Leggings has been raised from 3 to 4, for a 2x speed boost over default.
* Client-side rendering performance improvement when highlighting camouflageable blocks (while holding the Camouflage Applicator).
* To hover in-place with the Jet Boots, only 7 Jet Boots Upgrades are now required, instead of 10.
* Aerial Interface now uses much less air to keep a player's air topped up.
* Players will no longer take thorns damage when attacking (Elder) Guardians with the Minigun.
* Some more Pressure Chamber work:
  * Client-side rendering (particles and items in chamber) is skipped if the chamber multiblock has no glass blocks.
  * Particle rendering is skipped if the player is more than 16 blocks away from the chamber (specifically: the chamber's primary valve).
  * A particle effect is played when the multiblock initially forms.
  * Air particle density in the chamber now responds better to changes in chamber pressure (better syncing to clients).
  * Pressure Chamber Interface door open/close sound is now a bit louder, but also no longer repeatedly plays over itself.
* Immersive Petroleum Gasoline is now accepted as a fuel in the liquid compressors by default; it's equivalent in quality to PneumaticCraft's Fuel.
* Sneak-wrenching a pneumatic machine now preserves any stored air in the dropped block (breaking the machine with a pick still loses stored air).
* Air leak sound pitch is now somewhat dependent on the pressure of the leak (higher pressure = higher-pitched leak sound)
* FoV change (zoom out) when Pneumatic Leggings speed boost is active has been removed. Added a clientside config setting D:leggingsFOVfactor if you prefer to keep the FoV adjustment (or would like a smaller adjustment) - 1.0 (default) for no adjustment, 0.0 for maximum adjustment.
* When Elevators are moving, Elevator Frames now "nudge" the player toward the centre of the block if they're hanging off by more than a little. Still possible to force-walk off the elevator platform if you're so inclined, though.
* Elevators now only "grab" entities within their frames if the entity is with 2.5 blocks vertically of the moving platform (previous behaviour was to grab regardless of height which can be a little... startling)
* Elevator Frames now only cancel fall damage if it's onto a moving elevator platform.
* Some IGW pages have had extra or clearer information added.
* Charging Module is lighter on server CPU now (CPU usage was quite heavy when charging a player's Pneumatic Armor via an Aerial Interface).
* Redid sound effect for Jet Boots a bit (lower-pitched, also modified to be lower & quieter when underwater)
#### Fixes
* Fixed some configurable values (e.g. blocks per elevator base) not being adjustable from the default.
* Fixed a deadlock issue with the Omnidirectional Hopper.  Under certain circumstances (all slots in the hopper partially full) it could fail to find suitable items in the input inventory.
* Fixed an item dupe in the Pressure Chamber under some fairly specific circumstances (related to performance improvements in 0.8.1).
* Fixed camouflageable blocks not being breakable with a pick (only a wrench) - related to camouflage updates in 0.8.1.
* Targeting Pressure Tube modules now works correctly for TOP & WAILA information display.
* Fixed some JEI Pressure Chamber recipes not showing the correct number of ingredients for some recipes (those items added by oredict key).
* Fixed an arithmetic rounding error causing Speed Upgrades to be less effective than they should have been in the Charging Station.
* Fixed problem with the Pneumatic Armor GUI causing a client crash when opened.  I couldn't reproduce this myself, but I've had confirmation that my fix appears to have succeeded...
* Fixed cosmetic issue where Pneumatic Armor feature enable/disable message were shown even when the corresponding upgrade(s) weren't installed (the actual features were not enabled, though)
* Fixed a few cosmetic "Format Error" strings in GUI info tabs.

### 0.8.1-274 (8 Oct 2018)
#### Updates
* The Advancement tree has been greatly expanded.  Many many more advancements are now available, and some give XP rewards.
* Significant performance improvement for the Refinery: now uses far less CPU when idle, and significantly less when processing.
* Significant performance improvement for the Pressure Chamber, which was unnecessarily recalculating recipes every tick (when it only needed to recalculate when chamber contents changed).
* Pressure Chamber now plays a quiet "pop" sound when crafting occurs (not more than once per 5 ticks, and you need to be pretty close to hear it).
* Camouflaging updates:
  * Connected textures are now supported!  With thanks to Botania; I figured out how to do this by looking at the Abstruse Platform code.
  * Breaking a camouflaged block now breaks off the camouflage without breaking the underlying block.
  * Applying the same camouflage to a block twice now just plays a click and does nothing (previously it reapplied the camo block, unnecessarily using pressure from the Camo Applicator).
* Some JEI work:
  * Added support for Heat Frame Cooling recipes (by default just lava bucket->obsidian and water bucket->ice, but recipes can be added with CraftTweaker).
  * Recipes which show a pressure gauge (Pressure Chamber, Thermopneumatic Processing Plant) now have a tooltip on the gauge graphic showing the exact pressure required.
  * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant recipes which don't care about pressure (Lubricant & Plastic by default) no longer show the pressure gauge at all.
  * JEI now shows Pressure Chamber enchanting & disenchanting recipes.
#### Fixes
* Pressure Chamber GUI: "Pressure" side tab now shows correct Volume information for the chamber.
* Fixed visual bug where Pressure Tubes would appear to disconnect after a Tube Module GUI was closed.
* Fixed not being able to manually insert oil into a Refinery by right-clicking with a fluid container in hand.
* Fixed side checkboxes in RF Import/Export puzzle pieces being ignored (drones would always try to access all sides until one side succeeded)

### 0.8.0-267 (17 Sep 2018)
#### New
* Logistics frames now support fuzzy item meta and NBT matching, as well as whitelist/blacklist for filters. This can all be configured with a new side tab on the right of the logistics GUI. Default is whitelist, match meta, ignore NBT, as before.
* Shulkers can be now be hacked (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker & Security Upgrades).  Disables Shulker missile attack and (usually) forces them open.
* Some quality of life improvements to Drone Debugging (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker and Dispenser upgrades):
  * In the debug screen, any widget which has an area can be right-clicked to show the area in-world.  Right-click again to stop showing the area.
  * Added "Show Start" and "Show Active" buttons to jump the debug display to the Start widget or currently executing widget, respectively.
  * Added "Follow Active" checkbox, which when selected, will continuously jump the debug display to the currently executing widget.
* Aerial Interface and Programmable Controller now have a GUI tab to configure which sides of the block should be connected to which inventory:
  * Default for Aerial Interface is top & bottom -> armor slots, sides -> player main inventory, as before.
  * Default for Programmable Controller is bottom -> programmable slot, other faces -> fake drone inventory, as before.
  * Aerial Interface now also supports interfacing with player's offhand slot and (vanilla) Ender inventory.
  * Additionally, any face of the two blocks can be disconnected from any inventory.
  * Both blocks are now rotatable (this is required for side configuration to work properly).  Default rotation for any pre-existing blocks is North - you can rotate the blocks as normal with a wrench.
  * Both blocks have had a bit of a re-texture to make it clear where the front is.
* Explosion crafting (i.e. converting iron to compressed iron via an explosion) is now manageable with CraftTweaker:
  * Arbitrary mappings of input item (or oredict entry) to output item can now be added or removed, but the mapping is always 1:1, with a configurable (average) loss rate.
  * API docs will eventually be on https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/ but in the meantime see https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/108
  * The config setting I:configCompressedIngotLossRate still exists, but applies *only* to the default compressed iron ingot & block recipes added by the mod.  For general loss rate configuration, use CraftTweaker.
  * JEI display for explosion crafting has changed slightly due to the possibilty of multiple possible recipes for one output; the description text is now a tooltip shown by hovering over the little explosion icon.
#### Updates
* Speed Upgrades are now slightly less expensive to use in machines in terms of fuel usage and heat generation.  Default multiplier is now 1.65, down from 1.8.  Note that this is exponential: usage is multiplier_value^num_speed_upgrades.
* The multipliers for Speed Upgrades are now configurable, in the "machine_properties" section of the config: D:speedUpgradeSpeedMultiplier and D:speedUpgradeUsageMultiplier.
* Several crafting recipes now produce more output:
  * All logistics frames: 4 frames instead of 1
  * Pneumatic Cylinder: 2 cylinders instead of 1
  * All programming puzzle pieces: 8 pieces instead of 4
* UV Light Box progress rate is now dependent on the exposure level of the PCB it's processing: much faster at low levels, a little slower at high levels.  The overall time it takes to fully expose a PCB (10 minutes with no speed upgrades) is unchanged, but this makes for a more interesting tradeoff of processing speed vs. etching failure chance (previously there was no good reason not to expose a PCB to 100%).
* When UV Light Box is set to emit a redstone signal at a given exposure level, automated (piped) extraction is only possible when the exposure level is high enough to emit a signal.  This makes for easier automation, but note that vanilla hoppers won't work here due to redstone signal emission; use an Omnidirectional Hopper or some other item transport system.
* Entity Selector strings (as used in Sentry Turret, Drone Programs, (advanced) Air Grate Module can now be a sequence of filters, separated by ";".  If any element of the sequence matches, the filter matches.  e.g. "@mob;shulker" will match any mob or a shulker (shulkers, although hostile, are considered by Minecraft to be golems rather than mobs).
* The minimum temperature for fluids to be considered as fuels for Liquid Compressors has been raised to 373K (100C) and is now configurable (see I:minimumFluidFuelTemperature)
* When using a Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker installed, drones no longer automatically show redstone particles where they're working; you now also need to have the Entity Tracker enabled, and have a Dispenser Upgrade installed (which is also required for drone debugging).  You also need to be within 32 blocks of the drone.
* Jet Boots flight is now a little more hazardous at Hard difficulty level; you will take more damage from horizontal collisions, and your boots won't absorb all the fall damage if you hit the ground while thrusting.
#### Fixes
* Removing a drone or Network API from the programmable controller now resets its digging position, preventing a phantom digging laser being shown.
* Fixed item loss bug with logistics drones and logistics modules when requesting a specific number of items from a Requester Frame with some (but not all) non-vanilla inventories.
* Logistics Frames can now once more be configured when in item form by right clicking (this is an old 1.7.10 feature that stopped working in the port to 1.12.2).
* Logistics Frame item tooltips now once more show their filter settings when shift is held (again, old 1.7.10 feature).
* WAILA/TOP info now shows detailed Logistics Frame filter information when player sneaks.
* Logistics Requester Frame now correctly requests fluids.
* Fixed log spam for Aphorism tile (was wrongly sending sync packets from client side)

### 0.7.8-259 (28 Aug 2018)
#### Updates
* Breaking any PneumaticCraft block by shift-clicking with any wrench will now keep any installed upgrades in the dropped block. Breaking the block with a pickaxe drops the upgrades, as before.
* Info tab on the GUI for all Logistics frames (shown by right-clicking with Logistics Configurator) has better descriptions for each frame type.
* Added client-side config setting (B:semiBlockLighting) to control if block lighting should be used on semiblocks like the logistics frames and heat frame. True by default, but can be set to false if lighting is glitchy.
#### Fixes
* Hopefully fix item loss issues with Programmable Controller (this needs more testing before release!)
* Fix problem with Programmable Controllers and tools like the Draconic Staff of Power which drop items at the player's location (fake player's location was wrong, causing items to be dropped in odd places)
* Fix occasional caching problem where neighbouring tile entities were not detected by PneumaticCraft blocks
* Fix greedy Amadron drones stealing all the fluid from your tank instead of the advertised amount.
* Fix intermittent Amadron tablet desync (caused when a periodic offer which happened to match a static offer was shuffled out)
* Drones now once more render their targeting laser while digging blocks like they did in 1.7.10 (actually they always did, but with an alpha value of 0...)
* GUI redstone control tab: the redstone button no longer sometimes renders excessively wide.

### 0.7.7-255 (16 Aug 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed stupid bug I added in 0.7.4 which caused Amadron offers to sometimes go out of sync on client & server, breaking the whole Amadron system.

### 0.7.6-254 (13 Aug 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed items in pressure chamber not always syncing to client properly.
* Fixed air amount showing negative in vacuum pump info tab: minimum is now floored at 0mL.
* Fixed heat frames and logistics frames looking unnaturally bright when in dark areas.  Note heat frame still glows (but doesn't emit light) when hot.
* Fixed pressure chamber valve sync errors in the log which may occur when loading a save from versions of PNC:R earlier than 0.7.2 (size of internal pressure chamber item buffer changed)
* Fixed problem where burn time of lava buckets in furnaces was badly nerfed; this was a change that should only have affected buckets containing PNC:R's own fuels.
* Fixed (hopefully) ConcurrentModificationException crash, possibly when changing dimensions (leaving the End?). This was not one that we could reproduce ourselves, but some extra protection code has been added to be safe. Might be related to some other mod causing chunks to be loaded on a different thread.
* Fixed rendering of minigun when held by other players
* Fixed ClassCastException being thrown (log spam) when firing minigun
* Fixed sync packets wrongly being sent from client-side pressure chamber valve code (log spam)
* Fixed (hopefully) semiblocks rendering leaking across dimensions (semiblocks are logistics frames, heat frames, crop supports, spawner agitators & transfer gadgets)
* Fixed visual issue with some JEI recipes (explosion crafting, UV light box, PCB etching) seen in newer JEI release

### 0.7.5-248 (26 Jul 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed NPE when using a newly-crafted GPS Area Tool
* Fixed Amadron offers not syncing properly in 'Open to LAN' worlds
* Fixed client kick when trying to add periodic Amadron offers on dedicated server

### 0.7.4-244 (25 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Amadron Tablet has seen a lot of attention...
  * Recoloured GUI background to now match what the item looks like
  * Moved the lesser-used "Add Trade" button into its own "Custom Trades" side tab. This button often appeared to get confused with the "Place Order" button beside it, which is what most players more often want to do.
  * Also in "Custom Trades", added 2 buttons which admin players can use to add custom periodic & static trades via the GUI.  Players need the "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addPeriodicTrade" and/or "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade" Forge permission nodes to do this (which by default means being an op). Note that custom periodic trades can't (yet) be removed via GUI; edit the "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersPeriodic.cfg" & "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg" files to do that.
  * Also added a button for admin players to add custom static trades via the GUI, with the same restrictions as for custom periodic trades (permission node "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade", file "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg").
  * "Place Order" button is now greyed out when the basket is empty
  * Added audible feedback when an order is successfully placed
  * Trade items with NBT are now supported (e.g. vanilla potions or enchanted books, and many modded items).  Note that the Amadron system will always try to match exactly the metadata and NBT you added the trade with.
* A bit more work (hopefully the last) on smoother fluid tank updates to client
* Can now install up to 10 Jet Boots upgrades in the Pneumatic Boots.  10 upgrades allows hovering in-place, but watch out for the in-flight air cost...
* Some tile entity performance improvements, most notably with the (output mode) Pressure Chamber Interface which was wasting a lot of CPU time but also to a lesser degree with the Air Compressor, UV Light Box and Sentry Turret
* Drones are now 50% faster (this makes up for the fact that they don't travel diagonally anymore)
* Performance improvements with the Charging Module (similar to Charging Station improvements in 0.7.3 release)
* Minigun ammo can now also be crafted with splash & lingering potions to get the corresponding splash/linger effect. But be warned, splash ammo get used up 3 times as fast, and lingering ammo 6 times as fast.
* Minigun ammo potion proc chance is now configurable - see I:minigunPotionProcChance in config)
* Added 3 methods to the Drone Interface computer peripheral: getDroneName(), getOwnerName(), getOwnerID()
* Magma blocks are now treated as heat sources
* Made the thermal resistance of non-vanilla fluids configurable - see D:fluidThermalResistance.  Default is 10; higher values make heat move from fluids to adjacent heat handlers more slowly.
#### Fixes
* Fixed Amadron restocking/payout drones (for player-player trading) spawning twice
* Fixed custom Amadron fluid trades not working
* Fixed NPE when trying to extract items from bottom side of Aerial Interface
* Fixed some armor features (magnet, charging) functioning even without the necessary upgrades installed
* Fixed Minigun Ammo not being craftable

### 0.7.3-239 (16 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Reworked 3rd party wrench support: many more wrenches are now supported
* More performance work with fluid tank sync'ing, reducing the rate at which tanks sync to client
* Charging Station now performs far better with many Speed Upgrades installed (was causing severe FPS drops)
* A few IGW updates, in particular the new Pneumatic Armor pieces are now documented
* Shift-left-clicking a GPS Tool in the Programmer GUI now creates a corresponding Area puzzle piece (this is an addition to the existing Left-Click to create a Coordinate puzzle piece)
#### Fixes
* Toggling jet boots off while thrusting no longer causes a desync
* Area GPS Tool now works on dedicated servers
* Mechanic Villagers created in the Pressure Chamber now have the right set of trades
* Wrenching PNC machines with 3rd party wrenches no longer also opens the machine's GUI
* Wrenching Pressure Tubes with 3rd party wrenches no longer causes a crash, and works as expected
* Breaking tile entities with empty fluid tanks no longer writes empty NBT data to the dropped item (so it will stack with other fresh items of the same type)
* Partially fixed navigation in the Coordinate Tracker upgrade for the helmet.  This needs more work, though (pathfinding has changed significantly since the upgrade was first created back in MC 1.6/1.7)

### 0.7.2-234 (11 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Pneumatic Door now plays a (suitably pneumatic) opening/closing sound effect.
* Some performance improvement work, particularly around Omni and Liquid Hoppers.  In particular, extracting from the Refinery with Liquid Hoppers caused significant FPS drops.
* Liquid Hoppers no longer accept input fluids on their output face, and will no longer output fluids from their input face.  (Related to performance improvements mentioned above)
* Tile Entities with fluid tanks now send far fewer updates to the client (also related to aforementioned performance work).  Previously they sent an update whenever the tank's contents changed, which is overkill for just rendering fluids.  Now updates are only sent when the contents change by more than 1% of the tank's total capacity. Can be adjusted in config - see 'D:liquidTankUpdateThreshold'.
#### Fixes
* Added back a missing texture for Aphorism Tile
* Fixed a server crash caused by a null ItemStack reference in Amadron custom offer handling

### 0.7.1-231 (9 Jul 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed startup crash under some circumstances (most likely with Thaumcraft not installed) related to new Pneumatic Armor
* No longer attempts to render armor initialisation progress bar if armor piece has no pressure

### 0.7.0-228 (8 Jul 2018)
#### New
* Big new feature: a fully-fledged Pneumatic Armor suite!  Added in Pneumatic Chestplate, Leggings & Boots, each with their own upgrades and abilities (read on...)
* To see all upgrades and abilities for each armor piece, put them in a Charging Station, and open the upgrade inventory from the Charging Station GUI (click the "Inv." button)
* Charging Upgrades (1-5) in the Chestplate charge all pressurizable armor and items you're carrying from the Chestplate's air tank (the Chestplate has a very large tank by default, and all pieces can be further upgraded with Volume Upgrades)
* Security Upgrade in the Chestplate gives protection from fire & lava (pressure cost: high)
* Magnet Upgrade (1-6) in the Chestplate attracts nearby items to the player (pressure cost: very low).  The Magnet respects Immersive Engineering's Conveyor Belts (in fact any item entity with the "PreventRemoteMovement" NBT tag) and Botania's Solegnolia.
* Speed Upgrades (1-3) in the Leggings give a run speed boost (pressure cost: very low)
* Range Upgrades (1-6) in the Leggings give a jump boost (pressure cost: low)
* Dispenser Upgrades (1-4) in the Boots allow you to kick entities for moderate damage and heavy knockback (pressure cost: low)
* The Pneumatic Boots give step assist for free and fall protection for a modest pressure cost (depending on the height of the fall)
* Jet Boots Upgrades (1-8) in the Boots allow limited flight (pressure cost: high)
* Pneumatic Armor has the same armor rating as iron, but +1 Toughness (for comparison, diamond armor has +2 Toughness)
* Armor Upgrades (1-4) in any armor piece increase its protection and toughness.  2 Armor Upgrades will provide protection equivalent to diamond, 4 upgrades is superior to diamond.
* Item Life Upgrades (1-6) in any armor piece allow auto-repair at a cost of pressure.  More upgrades cause faster, but less air-efficient, repair.
* All Pneumatic Helmet functions remain available; just to note that Horses can now be tamed via helmet hacking.
* All features can be toggled on/off using the familiar Pneumatic Helmet options GUI, and as before, keys can be bound to toggle any feature without opening the GUI.
#### Updates
* Quality of Life: shift-clicking a Pneumatic armor piece while in the Charging Station GUI will move it to the right place (armor slots -> charging slot, charging slot -> armor slot, player inv slots -> charging slot)
* Aphorism Tiles are now considered passable by drones, like vanilla signs.  (Note Aphorism Tiles will not be washed away by water, so useful for an underwater base)
* Performance: Aphorism Tiles are no longer ticking tile entities.
* Aphorism Tiles can now be recoloured by right-clicking with any dye (oredict-aware).  Tile border and background can be recoloured independently.
* Drones will now auto-equip the best (highest damage, taking enchantments into account) weapon in their inventory when entering combat (only applies with upgraded inventories, of course).
* Handheld minigun now has a proper rotating model!
* Minigun bullets cause a (cosmetic) particle effect on blocks they hit.  No block breaking, though.
#### Fixes
* Drones have been taught how to melee 1.9 style.  They were still fighting 1.7.10 style, which made them hopeless at melee.
* Hacked drones will no longer obnoxiously shove their owner around; instead they'll come to the owner and land in front of them.
* Fix: better behaviour for drones when targeting entities they can't pathfind to (they were getting stuck in a about-to-teleport loop)
* Fix: server crash if a drone carrying multiple buckets tried to milk a cow.  Now the drone will drop any milk buckets that it has no inventory space for on the ground.
* Fix: Pressure Chambers with multiple valves will now be properly reformed when world is reloaded (previously auxiliary valves didn't think they were part of the multiblock, and leaked air)
* Fix: right clicking a refinery block with a bucket or other fluid container will now extract the right fluid (previously it always tried to extract from the bottom block in the stack, regardless of which block was clicked)
* Fix: the Light Condition puzzle piece was miscalculating light levels

### 0.6.8-219 (27 Jun 2018)
#### Updates
* Change to Drones and Security Upgrades (liquid protection): 1 Security Upgrade will now allow drones to swim through liquids, 2 Security Upgrades will create a temporary 3x3x3 air bubble around drones which are in a liquid, and 3+ Security Upgrades will permanently remove any liquids a drone flies through.  Drones will still never pathfind through lava, though.
#### Fixes
* Fixed Computer Control program piece not getting registered with Open Computers installed
* Fixed drones having their AI overridden by carried entities (Entity Import program piece)
* Fixed inability to place Heat Frames on inventories
* Fixed possible lockup (endless loop) on startup with drones
* Fixed spurious "Drone has no UUID!" error messages on the client
* Fixed occasional crashes when teleporting into areas with client-side (TESR) renderers

### 0.6.7-210 (10 Jun 2018)

#### New
* Added support for Thaumcraft 6.  Thaumcraft Upgrade is now craftable and adds Goggles of Revealing functionality to the Pneumatic Helmet.  Aspects have been added to a few PneumaticCraft items (beyond any Thaumcraft auto-detection).
* The Omnidirectional Hopper and Liquid Hopper now have comparator support to measure their fullness.

#### Updates
* Logistics Drones now grab as many of the requested item type as can fit in a single item stack, instead of taking simply the first stack from the inventory.
* Upgrade descriptions for Pneumatic Helmet & Drones in the Charging Station GUI are now much more complete and accurate; all applicable upgrades are documented, and inapplicable upgrades are no longer shown and cannot be installed (e.g. Logistics Drones can't use Dispenser Upgrades).
* Particles in the Pressure Chamber are slightly less dense now, and render higher inside the chamber.  Allows items in the chamber to actually be seen when the pressure is high; previously particle cloud obscured any items.
* Any items crafted with Air Canisters now get any air in the canister(s)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Sync issue with Pressure Gauge GUI toggling the '<' / '>' button.
* Fix: crash with Ice & Fire Cyclops attacking Sentry Turrets
* Fix: dedicated server crash with drones and the Magnet Upgrade
* Fix: dedicated server crash when hacking mob spawners with Pneumatic Helmet
* Fix: client desync for Logistics Frames after configuring them with Logistics Configurator
* Fix: Logistics Frames & other semiblocks not always sync'ing properly to the client on initial player login
* Fix: items not always transferring in Logistics Network (using tubes & Logistics Modules)
* Fix: it's now possible to place blocks against GUI-less blocks like Compressed Iron Block without needing to sneak-right-click

### 0.6.6-192 (14 May 2018)

#### Updates
* The Universal Sensor no longer uses air in the "Constant" redstone emitter mode (still requires minimum pressure though)
#### Fixes
* Fix: crash when right-clicking some PneumaticCraft blocks with other mods' wrenches
* Fix: another fix to Speed Upgrade crafting with stacks of more than one item in the table

### 0.6.5-189 (11 May 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: crash when crafting Speed Upgrades in some situations.
* Fix: Gas Lift now works with infinite fluid blocks such as Better With Addons Aqueducts.

### 0.6.4-186 (3 May 2018)

#### Updates
* Compressed Iron Gear now added to Ore Dictionary as "gearIronCompressed".  This allows Thermal Expansion Compactor to craft Compressed Iron Gears when the Gearworking Die Augment is installed.
* Plastic Mixer JEI page now uses Ore Dictionary to show the dyes instead of hard-coded vanilla dye items. (Mods and/or packs can remove vanilla dyes from the oredict so hardcoded items can be misleading)
#### Fixes
* Fix: client crash when looking at RFTools Powercells with the Pneumatic Helmet Block Upgrade Tracker active (and RF scanning enabled).  The RF scanner still doesn't get the RF level; a more comprehensive data syncing framework for the Pneumatic Helmet is being considered.
* Fix: Removed Upgrade Info tab from Refinery GUI (the block doesn't take any upgrades)
* Fix: Nasty item-equip sound loop being played when Pneumatic Helmet equipped and Charging Station GUI open

### 0.6.3-181 (25 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Shift-click dupe bug (introduced in 0.6.0) when clicking items into some PneumaticCraft inventories.
* Fix: Dyeing a drone by right-clicking it now only uses one dye from the stack, not two.
* Fix: Blocks can now be placed against the Charging Station & Elevator Caller with sneak-right-click.

### 0.6.2-179 (24 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Server crash when Spawner Agitators are used in conjunction with the Despawning Spawners mod.
* Fix: Omnidirectional Hoppers now respect the sidedness of the block they pull from (e.g. will no longer pull input items or fuel from the bottom side of a vanilla furnace).

### 0.6.1-176 (22 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Crash with liquid lookup with JEI.
* Fix: Drones being quirky sometimes when digging.

### 0.6.0-174 (21 Apr 2018)

#### New
* Added Harvesting Drone, and Harvesting Piece.
* QoL improvement: Speed Upgrades can now be crafted with fluid containers holding more than a bucket of lubricant.  The Liquid Hopper works for this, and the Thermal Expansion and EnderIO tanks can also be used.  Other mods' containers may also work.
#### Updates
* QoL improvement: adding extra Refinery blocks to an existing stack will now automatically redistribute any output fluids to the appropriate tanks, so the Refinery can continue to run.  E.g. adding a Refinery to a 2-block stack which already contains Diesel and LPG will auto-move the LPG from the second to the third (newly added) block.
* Programmable Controller: all faces except the bottom face can be used to access the fake drone's inventory.  The bottom face can be used to insert or extract the programmable item (Drone or Network API).
* QoL improvement: Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now only accepts items/fluids that can be used in recipes.
#### Fixes
* Fix (cosmetic): Amadron no longer shows slot highlights where there isn't a trade widget (i.e. on the last page of trades).
* Fix: Breaking any PneumaticCraft tile entity with an auto-smelt pick (e.g. from Tinker's Construct) no longer smelts the tile entity's contents.
* Fix: MCMP2 support hard-disabled for now (switching it on in config would crash your game before)
* Fix: Elevator Caller now works properly when you have more than 12 floors
* Fix: Programmable Controller inventory handling now works properly (inventory manipulation widgets were accessing the controller's 1-slot inventory instead of the fake drone's inventory)
* Fix: Removing the programmable item (Drone or Network API) from the Programmable Controller's slot now properly stops and resets the running program.
* Fix: Rotating PNC blocks with other mods' wrenches should no longer also open the block's GUI.
* Fix: The Charging Station now only allows 1 item to be inserted, to prevent duping Machine Upgrades.
* Performance: fluid tank rendering now uses a FastTESR, better for client FPS.

### 0.5.1-163 (21 Mar 2018)
#### Updates
* Drones now also render held hoes upside down (just like other tools).
* Inserting/extracting the top side of the Programmable Controller block inserts/extracts "drone" inventory.
#### Fixes
* Fixed the Programmable Controller since the initial port (most notably a crash involving FTB Utilities).
* Fix server crash with Mekanism cardboard box & spawner agitator

### 0.5.0-159 (26 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Added GPS Area Tool, a way to make selecting areas with the Programmer easier.
* You can 'paste' Coordinate puzzle pieces in the Programmer by taking a GPS Tool and left-clicking it on the programming area (the GPS Area Tool does the same for the Area piece).
* Oil worldgen can now be blacklisted by dimension ID (e.g. disable oil generation in Twilight Forest) - see I:oilWorldGenBlacklist in pneumaticcraft.cfg
#### Updates
* Drones & Logistics Drones can now be spawned from a Dispenser
* Altered camera orientations for some held items (wrenches & other tools - thanks Teamspen210)
* Gas Lift air (pressure) usage when extending the tube is now dependent on the hardness of the block being broken (stone is the same, softer blocks are cheaper, and obsidian is much more expensive to break)
* Advanced Pressure Tubes can now be used in the Gas Lift, and will reduce the pressure cost to break blocks to 50%
* The Spawner Agitator is now found 10x less frequently in dungeon loot chests (it can still be crafted, though)
* Reworked some event handling code which should provide a significant performance improvement in worlds with many loaded tile entities
#### Fixes
* RF Import & RF Export programming pieces are now available (they were in, but registration was getting skipped due to a bug).  Also note that despite the name, these pieces work with Forge Energy, which is RF-compatible.
* Fixed a crash with the Amadron Tablet when adding a trade when not having a item supply location bound to the tablet
* Fixed Drones sometimes refusing to teleport while they should (most likely to notice with Place Block commands)
* Fixed entity filters in Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker module not working on dedicated servers
* Hopefully fixed server-side NPE with Programmable Controller and FTB Utilities claim protection
* Fixed Gas Lift being able to break unbreakable blocks (bedrock, ender portal frames...)

### 0.4.1-141 (10 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Added config option 'B:explosionCrafting', true by default. Setting this to false disables explosion crafting of compressed iron. If you disable this, you'll need another way to get initial compressed iron (e.g. via a CraftTweaker recipe)
#### Fixes
* Hopefully made PNC:R more robust with compatibility with other mods adding "oil" as a fluid.  PNC:R will now log an error and disable oil worldgen if it can't find oil as a block, rather than crashing the instance.
* Picking up modded fluids with Ceramics Clay Bucket no longer converts the Clay Bucket to a vanilla iron Bucket.
* Drone "Condition: Items" puzzle piece now works properly.
* Fixed potential client-side NPE in Aphorism Tiles when drama text is unavailable.

### 0.4.0-135 (1 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Programmer Area enhancements: Sphere, Cylinder and Pyramid types can now be configured as 'hollow', and the Area widget configuration GUI now has a much cleaner layout
* Programmer enhancement: added a search textfield, shown when the full widget tray is expanded, allowing easy location of puzzle pieces by name
* Programmer widget tray can now be toggled with the Tab hotkey (in addition to the existing Space hotkey), possibly useful when the new search field has focus
* Aerial Interface: added support for CoFH "Essence of Knowledge" experience fluid
* Aerial Interface: the Experience tab in the GUI now has a button to select the desired fluid type when you have multiple mods providing experience fluids (the old method of inserting some fluid to set the accepted type no longer works)
* Added two ComputerCraft methods for Elevators: getCurrentHeight() and getTargetHeight()
#### Updates
* Drone death messages to the owner are now more informative (include reason why drone died)
* Minigun tracers and Vortex entities no longer look so weird (bad X offset) when fired from the left hand
* IGW updates to Aerial Interface and Programmer wiki pages
#### Fixes
* Fixed client being kicked when trying to load very large drone programs from pastebin (exceeding 32K client->server packet limit; now sent in multiple packets - 1.7.10 had a higher packet size limit)
* Fixed client crash when using variables to define areas (related to changes in 0.3.0 regarding size limit validation)
* Fixed client crash in Programmer when zooming all the way out, exiting Programmer and then re-opening it
* Fixed some XP calculation inaccuracies in the Aerial Interface; pumping XP in & out should not cause any unexpected XP loss or gain now
* Fixed missing textures in the Area wiki page

### 0.3.1-125 (18 Jan 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix AbstractMethodError crashes introduced in 0.3.0.

### 0.3.0-124 (17 Jan 2018)
#### New
* Added Transfer Widget, an early game item/fluid transfer item that can be placed _between_ blocks.
* Added Spawner Agitator, which keeps Mob Spawners active even if players are not around.
* Added Crop Support, an item which when placed on a crop improves growth speed.
#### Updates
* Network Data Storage item now shows required puzzle pieces in its item tooltip when holding Shift
* Big performance improvement when searching in the item search GUI
* Better default orientation of the Omnidirection Hopper when it's placed: output now faces the clicked block, and input faces the player.
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas has been increased from 100,000 to 250,000 and can now be adjusted in config (see I:maxProgrammingArea)
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas is now validated in the Programmer before the drone is programmed, instead of forcing a drone with an over-large area to suicide after it's placed.
* Performance improvement: the tile entities for Pressure Chamber Wall/Glass & Elevator Frames no longer tick. Pressure Chamber Glass should be fine to use in small-scale decorative builds, or for its excellent blast-resistant properties. 
* Lots of work (mainly cleanup) on the In-Game-Wiki docs.
#### Fixes
* Fixed (hopefully) reflection-based crashes on startup when running with certain ASM-using coremods
* Fixed NPE's when breaking certain inventories or tanks with a Logistics Frame attached
* Fixed item dupe when Logistics Drone imported from inventories under certain circumstances
* Breaking any PneumaticCraft: Repressurized inventory in creative mode now drops the inventory contents instead of voiding them
* Fixed clientside crash when selecting the "Check For Air" option in "Condition: Block" programming widget
* Fixed Elevator Callers not working above the level of Elevator Frames - frames can now stop two blocks below the top Elevator Caller (thanks TeamSpen210)

### 0.2.2-102 (25 Dec 2017)
#### Fixes
* Fixed crash when removing an opened Pneumatic Door in survival mode.

### 0.2.1-101 (25 Dec 2017)
#### New
* Added CraftTweaker support for liquid fuels used in the Liquid Compressors and Kerosene Lamp.
#### Updates
* Vortex tube tube now briefly shows its hot and cold sides when placed or rotated
* Zoom scrollbar in Programmer GUI can now be dragged with mouse (you can also zoom in/out with mouse wheel)
* A sound effect now plays when writing a program to a Drone.
* Changed default keybinding for opening the Pneumatic Helmet from 'F' to 'U' (as 'F' is the 'switch to offhand' button).
#### Fixes
* Fixed the Heat Sink looking like it is facing up when actually facing down.
* Fixed CraftTweaker 'RemoveAllRecipes' function not working for all recipe handlers.
* Fixed item dupe when breaking charging stations holding items (helmet/drone...) with installed upgrades 
* Fixed fully UV Lightbox-ed Empty PCB's stacking with new Empty PCB's
* Fixed explosion-handling event related server crash after killing the wither (and potentially in other situations)
* Fixed keypresses in Programmer GUI "leaking" when the naming textfield was focused (e.g. pressing 'z' would do an Undo action)
* Zoom behaviour in Programmer GUI is now more consistent (zoom in & back out and you will be at the same place in the view)
* Fixed NPE when stacking Elevator Base blocks vertically
* Added missing translations for Pneumatic Helmet keybindings.
* Fixed Drones causing a crash in very specific situations in combination with FTB Utiltities (having to do with authorization).
* Bugfix: Forestry ethanol does not get registered as a fuel and posts a stacktrace in the log.

### 0.2.0-85 (12 Dec 2017)
#### New
* IC2 machines are back: Pneumatic Generator and Electric Compressor (but lacking the pretty models they had in 1.7.10, sorry)
* Build artifacts (including API) are now available at https://modmaven.k-4u.nl/me/desht/pneumaticcraft/pneumaticcraft-repressurized/
#### Updates
* Air Compressor & Advanced Air Compressor no longer take fuel buckets
* Furnace burn time of fuel buckets is now configurable, and 10x shorter by default than before
* Empty PCB's now stack
* Recipes are now pretty much all done with JSON
#### Fixes
* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet block tracker client crash with unopened loot chests
* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker client crash when targeting other players
* Fixed Pressure Chamber Interface sometimes becoming an infinite source of items
* Fixed occasional client crash with Gas Lift
* Drone pathfinding is a lot better now
* Drone "Right Click Block" now works a lot better
* Drones now render their held item (can be disabled in config)
* Many, many, other minor bugfixes and overall polishing (see https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master)

### 0.1.0-47 (19 Nov 2017)
#### Updates
* Minor GUI tweaks for Programmer and Remote
#### Fixes
* Hotfix: client crash when holding newly crafted GPS Tool or Amadron Tablet

### 0.1.0-45 (18 Nov 2017)
* Initial alpha1 release
