# PneumaticCraft: Repressurized - Changelog

This is an overview of significant new features and fixes by release.  See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master for a detailed list of all changes.

Changes are in reverse chronological order; newest changes at the top.

## Minecraft 1.12.2

## 0.6.0-??? (unreleased)

* Added Harvesting Drone, and Harvesting Piece.
* QoL improvement: Speed Upgrades can now be crafted with fluid containers holding more than a bucket of lubricant.  The Liquid Hopper works for this, and the Thermal Expansion and EnderIO tanks can also be used.  Other mods' containers may also work.
* QoL improvement: adding extra Refinery blocks to an existing stack will now automatically redistribute any output fluids to the appropriate tanks, so the Refinery can continue to run.  E.g. adding a Refinery to a 2-block stack which already contains Diesel and LPG will auto-move the LPG from the second to the third (newly added) block.
* Programmable Controller: all faces except the bottom face can be used to access the fake drone's inventory.  The bottom face can be used to insert or extract the programmable item (Drone or Network API).
* Fix (cosmetic): Amadron no longer shows slot highlights where there isn't a trade widget (i.e. on the last page of trades).
* Fix: Breaking any PneumaticCraft tile entity with an auto-smelt pick (e.g. from Tinker's Construct) no longer smelts the tile entity's contents.
* Fix: MCMP2 support hard-disabled for now (switching it on in config would crash your game before)
* Fix: Elevator Caller now works properly when you have more than 12 floors
* Fix: Programmable Controller inventory handling now works properly (inventory manipulation widgets were accessing the controller's 1-slot inventory instead of the fake drone's inventory)
* Fix: Removing the programmable item (Drone or Network API) from the Programmable Controller's slot now properly stops and resets the running program.
* Fix: Rotating PNC blocks with other mods' wrenches should no longer also open the block's GUI.
* Fix: The Charging Station now only allows 1 item to be inserted, to prevent duping Machine Upgrades.
* Performance: fluid tank rendering now uses a FastTESR, better for client FPS.

## 0.5.1-163 (21 Mar 2018)

* Drones now also render held hoes upside down (just like other tools).
* Fixed the Programmable Controller since the initial port (most notably a crash involving FTB Utilities).
* Inserting/extracting the top side of the Programmable Controller block inserts/extracts "drone" inventory.
* Fix server crash with Mekanism cardboard box & spawner agitator

## 0.5.0-159 (26 Feb 2018)

* Added GPS Area Tool, a way to make selecting areas with the Programmer easier.
* You can 'paste' Coordinate puzzle pieces in the Programmer by taking a GPS Tool and left-clicking it on the programming area (the GPS Area Tool does the same for the Area piece).
* Drones & Logistics Drones can now be spawned from a Dispenser
* Altered camera orientations for some held items (wrenches & other tools - thanks Teamspen210)
* Oil worldgen can now be blacklisted by dimension ID (e.g. disable oil generation in Twilight Forest) - see I:oilWorldGenBlacklist in pneumaticcraft.cfg
* RF Import & RF Export programming pieces are now available (they were in, but registration was getting skipped due to a bug).  Also note that despite the name, these pieces work with Forge Energy, which is RF-compatible.
* Gas Lift air (pressure) usage when extending the tube is now dependent on the hardness of the block being broken (stone is the same, softer blocks are cheaper, and obsidian is much more expensive to break)
* Advanced Pressure Tubes can now be used in the Gas Lift, and will reduce the pressure cost to break blocks to 50%
* The Spawner Agitator is now found 10x less frequently in dungeon loot chests (it can still be crafted, though)
* Fixed a crash with the Amadron Tablet when adding a trade when not having a item supply location bound to the tablet
* Fixed Drones sometimes refusing to teleport while they should (most likely to notice with Place Block commands)
* Fixed entity filters in Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker module not working on dedicated servers
* Reworked some event handling code which should provide a significant performance improvement in worlds with many loaded tile entities
* Hopefully fixed server-side NPE with Programmable Controller and FTB Utilities claim protection
* Fixed Gas Lift being able to break unbreakable blocks (bedrock, ender portal frames...)

## 0.4.1-141 (10 Feb 2018)

* Hopefully made PNC:R more robust with compatibility with other mods adding "oil" as a fluid.  PNC:R will now log an error and disable oil worldgen if it can't find oil as a block, rather than crashing the instance.
* Added config option 'B:explosionCrafting', true by default. Setting this to false disables explosion crafting of compressed iron. If you disable this, you'll need another way to get initial compressed iron (e.g. via a CraftTweaker recipe)
* Picking up modded fluids with Ceramics Clay Bucket no longer converts the Clay Bucket to a vanilla iron Bucket.
* Drone "Condition: Items" puzzle piece now works properly.
* Fixed potential client-side NPE in Aphorism Tiles when drama text is unavailable.

## 0.4.0-135 (1 Feb 2018)

* Programmer Area enhancements: Sphere, Cylinder and Pyramid types can now be configured as 'hollow', and the Area widget configuration GUI now has a much cleaner layout
* Programmer enhancement: added a search textfield, shown when the full widget tray is expanded, allowing easy location of puzzle pieces by name
* Programmer widget tray can now be toggled with the Tab hotkey (in addition to the existing Space hotkey), possibly useful when the new search field has focus
* Aerial Interface: added support for CoFH "Essence of Knowledge" experience fluid
* Aerial Interface: the Experience tab in the GUI now has a button to select the desired fluid type when you have multiple mods providing experience fluids (the old method of inserting some fluid to set the accepted type no longer works)
* Added two ComputerCraft methods for Elevators: getCurrentHeight() and getTargetHeight()
* Drone death messages to the owner are now more informative (include reason why drone died)
* Minigun tracers and Vortex entities no longer look so weird (bad X offset) when fired from the left hand
* Fixed client being kicked when trying to load very large drone programs from pastebin (exceeding 32K client->server packet limit; now sent in multiple packets - 1.7.10 had a higher packet size limit)
* Fixed client crash when using variables to define areas (related to changes in 0.3.0 regarding size limit validation)
* Fixed client crash in Programmer when zooming all the way out, exiting Programmer and then re-opening it
* Fixed some XP calculation inaccuracies in the Aerial Interface; pumping XP in & out should not cause any unexpected XP loss or gain now
* Fixed missing textures in the Area wiki page
* IGW updates to Aerial Interface and Programmer wiki pages

## 0.3.1-125 (18 Jan 2018)

* Fix AbstractMethodError crashes introduced in 0.3.0.

## 0.3.0-124 (17 Jan 2018)

* Added Transfer Widget, an early game item/fluid transfer item that can be placed _between_ blocks.
* Added Spawner Agitator, which keeps Mob Spawners active even if players are not around.
* Added Crop Support, an item which when placed on a crop improves growth speed.
* Network Data Storage item now shows required puzzle pieces in its item tooltip when holding Shift
* Big performance improvement when searching in the item search GUI
* Better default orientation of the Omnidirection Hopper when it's placed: output now faces the clicked block, and input faces the player.
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas has been increased from 100,000 to 250,000 and can now be adjusted in config (see I:maxProgrammingArea)
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas is now validated in the Programmer before the drone is programmed, instead of forcing a drone with an over-large area to suicide after it's placed.
* Fixed (hopefully) reflection-based crashes on startup when running with certain ASM-using coremods
* Fixed NPE's when breaking certain inventories or tanks with a Logistics Frame attached
* Fixed item dupe when Logistics Drone imported from inventories under certain circumstances
* Breaking any PneumaticCraft: Repressurized inventory in creative mode now drops the inventory contents instead of voiding them
* Fixed clientside crash when selecting the "Check For Air" option in "Condition: Block" programming widget
* Performance improvement: the tile entities for Pressure Chamber Wall/Glass & Elevator Frames no longer tick. Pressure Chamber Glass should be fine to use in small-scale decorative builds, or for its excellent blast-resistant properties. 
* Lots of work (mainly cleanup) on the In-Game-Wiki docs.
* Fixed Elevator Callers not working above the level of Elevator Frames - frames can now stop two blocks below the top Elevator Caller (thanks TeamSpen210)

## 0.2.2-102 (25 Dec 2017)

* Fixed crash when removing an opened Pneumatic Door in survival mode.

## 0.2.1-101 (25 Dec 2017)

* Added CraftTweaker support for liquid fuels used in the Liquid Compressors and Kerosene Lamp.
* Vortex tube tube now briefly shows its hot and cold sides when placed or rotated
* Fixed the Heat Sink looking like it is facing up when actually facing down.
* Fixed CraftTweaker 'RemoveAllRecipes' function not working for all recipe handlers.
* Fixed item dupe when breaking charging stations holding items (helmet/drone...) with installed upgrades 
* Fixed fully UV Lightbox-ed Empty PCB's stacking with new Empty PCB's
* Fixed explosion-handling event related server crash after killing the wither (and potentially in other situations)
* Fixed keypresses in Programmer GUI "leaking" when the naming textfield was focused (e.g. pressing 'z' would do an Undo action)
* Zoom scrollbar in Programmer GUI can now be dragged with mouse (you can also zoom in/out with mouse wheel)
* Zoom behaviour in Programmer GUI is now more consistent (zoom in & back out and you will be at the same place in the view)
* Fixed NPE when stacking Elevator Base blocks vertically
* A sound effect now plays when writing a program to a Drone.
* Added missing translations for Pneumatic Helmet keybindings.
* Changed default keybinding for opening the Pneumatic Helmet from 'F' to 'U' (as 'F' is the 'switch to offhand' button).
* Fixed Drones causing a crash in very specific situations in combination with FTB Utiltities (having to do with authorization).
* Bugfix: Forestry ethanol does not get registered as a fuel and posts a stacktrace in the log.

## 0.2.0-85 (12 Dec 2017)

* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet block tracker client crash with unopened loot chests
* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker client crash when targeting other players
* Fixed Pressure Chamber Interface sometimes becoming an infinite source of items
* Fixed occasional client crash with Gas Lift
* IC2 machines are back: Pneumatic Generator and Electric Compressor (but lacking the pretty models they had in 1.7.10, sorry)
* Air Compressor & Advanced Air Compressor no longer take fuel buckets
* Furnace burn time of fuel buckets is now configurable, and 10x shorter by default than before
* Drone pathfinding is a lot better now
