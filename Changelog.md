# PneumaticCraft: Repressurized - Changelog

This is an overview of significant new features and fixes by release.  See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master for a detailed list of all changes.

Changes are in reverse chronological order; newest changes at the top.

## Minecraft 1.12.2

### 0.8.0-??? (unreleased)
#### New
* Logistics frames now support fuzzy item meta and NBT matching, as well as whitelist/blacklist for filters. This can all be configured with a new side tab on the right of the logistics GUI. Default is whitelist, match meta, ignore NBT, as before.
* Shulkers can be now be hacked (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker & Security Upgrades).  Disables Shulker missile attack and (usually) forces them open.
* Some quality of life improvements to Drone Debugging (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker and Dispenser upgrades):
  * In the debug screen, any widget which has an area can be right-clicked to show the area in-world.  Right-click again to stop showing the area.
  * Added "Show Start" and "Show Active" buttons to jump the debug display to the Start widget or currently executing widget, respectively.
  * Added "Follow Active" checkbox, which when selected, will continuously jump the debug display to the currently executing widget.
* Aerial Interface and Programmable Controller now have a GUI tab to configure which sides of the block should be connected to which inventory:
  * Default for Aerial Interface is top & bottom -> armor slots, sides -> player main inventory, as before.
  * Default for Programmable Controller is bottom -> programmable slot, other faces -> fake drone inventory, as before.
  * Aerial Interface now also supports interfacing with player's offhand slot and (vanilla) Ender inventory.
  * Additionally, any face of the two blocks can be disconnected from any inventory.
  * Both blocks are now rotatable (this is required for side configuration to work properly).  Default rotation for any pre-existing blocks is North - you can rotate the blocks as normal with a wrench.
  * Both blocks have had a bit of a re-texture to make it clear where the front is.
* Explosion crafting (i.e. converting iron to compressed iron via an explosion) is now manageable with CraftTweaker:
  * Arbitrary mappings of input item (or oredict entry) to output item can now be added or removed, but the mapping is always 1:1, with a configurable (average) loss rate.
  * API docs will eventually be on https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/ but in the meantime see https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/108
  * The config setting I:configCompressedIngotLossRate still exists, but applies *only* to the default compressed iron ingot & block recipes added by the mod.  For general loss rate configuration, use CraftTweaker.
  * JEI display for explosion crafting has changed slightly due to the possibilty of multiple possible recipes for one output; the description text is now a tooltip shown by hovering over the little explosion icon.
#### Updates
* Speed Upgrades are now slightly less expensive to use in machines in terms of fuel usage and heat generation.  Default multiplier is now 1.65, down from 1.8.  Note that this is exponential: usage is multiplier_value^num_speed_upgrades.
* The multipliers for Speed Upgrades are now configurable, in the "machine_properties" section of the config: D:speedUpgradeSpeedMultiplier and D:speedUpgradeUsageMultiplier.
* Several crafting recipes now produce more output:
  * All logistics frames: 4 frames instead of 1
  * Pneumatic Cylinder: 2 cylinders instead of 1
  * All programming puzzle pieces: 8 pieces instead of 4
* UV Light Box progress rate is now dependent on the exposure level of the PCB it's processing: much faster at low levels, a little slower at high levels.  The overall time it takes to fully expose a PCB (10 minutes with no speed upgrades) is unchanged, but this makes for a more interesting tradeoff of processing speed vs. etching failure chance (previously there was no good reason not to expose a PCB to 100%).
* When UV Light Box is set to emit a redstone signal at a given exposure level, automated (piped) extraction is only possible when the exposure level is high enough to emit a signal.  This makes for easier automation, but note that vanilla hoppers won't work here due to redstone signal emission; use an Omnidirectional Hopper or some other item transport system.
* Entity Selector strings (as used in Sentry Turret, Drone Programs, (advanced) Air Grate Module can now be a sequence of filters, separated by ";".  If any element of the sequence matches, the filter matches.  e.g. "@mob;shulker" will match any mob or a shulker (shulkers, although hostile, are considered by Minecraft to be golems rather than mobs).
* The minimum temperature for fluids to be considered as fuels for Liquid Compressors has been raised to 373K (100C) and is now configurable (see I:minimumFluidFuelTemperature)
* When using a Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker installed, drones no longer automatically show redstone particles where they're working; you now also need to have the Entity Tracker enabled, and have a Dispenser Upgrade installed (which is also required for drone debugging).  You also need to be within 32 blocks of the drone.
* Jet Boots flight is now a little more hazardous at Hard difficulty level; you will take more damage from horizontal collisions, and your boots won't absorb all the fall damage if you hit the ground while thrusting.
#### Fixes
* Removing a drone or Network API from the programmable controller now resets its digging position, preventing a phantom digging laser being shown.
* Fixed item loss bug with logistics drones and logistics modules when requesting a specific number of items from a Requester Frame with some (but not all) non-vanilla inventories.
* Logistics Frames can now once more be configured when in item form by right clicking (this is an old 1.7.10 feature that stopped working in the port to 1.12.2).
* Logistics Frame item tooltips now once more show their filter settings when shift is held (again, old 1.7.10 feature).
* WAILA/TOP info now shows detailed Logistics Frame filter information when player sneaks.
* Logistics Requester Frame now correctly requests fluids.
* Fixed log spam for Aphorism tile (was wrongly sending sync packets from client side)

### 0.7.8-259 (28 Aug 2018)
#### Updates
* Breaking any PneumaticCraft block by shift-clicking with any wrench will now keep any installed upgrades in the dropped block. Breaking the block with a pickaxe drops the upgrades, as before.
* Info tab on the GUI for all Logistics frames (shown by right-clicking with Logistics Configurator) has better descriptions for each frame type.
* Added client-side config setting (B:semiBlockLighting) to control if block lighting should be used on semiblocks like the logistics frames and heat frame. True by default, but can be set to false if lighting is glitchy.
#### Fixes
* Hopefully fix item loss issues with Programmable Controller (this needs more testing before release!)
* Fix problem with Programmable Controllers and tools like the Draconic Staff of Power which drop items at the player's location (fake player's location was wrong, causing items to be dropped in odd places)
* Fix occasional caching problem where neighbouring tile entities were not detected by PneumaticCraft blocks
* Fix greedy Amadron drones stealing all the fluid from your tank instead of the advertised amount.
* Fix intermittent Amadron tablet desync (caused when a periodic offer which happened to match a static offer was shuffled out)
* Drones now once more render their targeting laser while digging blocks like they did in 1.7.10 (actually they always did, but with an alpha value of 0...)
* GUI redstone control tab: the redstone button no longer sometimes renders excessively wide.

### 0.7.7-255 (16 Aug 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed stupid bug I added in 0.7.4 which caused Amadron offers to sometimes go out of sync on client & server, breaking the whole Amadron system.

### 0.7.6-254 (13 Aug 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed items in pressure chamber not always syncing to client properly.
* Fixed air amount showing negative in vacuum pump info tab: minimum is now floored at 0mL.
* Fixed heat frames and logistics frames looking unnaturally bright when in dark areas.  Note heat frame still glows (but doesn't emit light) when hot.
* Fixed pressure chamber valve sync errors in the log which may occur when loading a save from versions of PNC:R earlier than 0.7.2 (size of internal pressure chamber item buffer changed)
* Fixed problem where burn time of lava buckets in furnaces was badly nerfed; this was a change that should only have affected buckets containing PNC:R's own fuels.
* Fixed (hopefully) ConcurrentModificationException crash, possibly when changing dimensions (leaving the End?). This was not one that we could reproduce ourselves, but some extra protection code has been added to be safe. Might be related to some other mod causing chunks to be loaded on a different thread.
* Fixed rendering of minigun when held by other players
* Fixed ClassCastException being thrown (log spam) when firing minigun
* Fixed sync packets wrongly being sent from client-side pressure chamber valve code (log spam)
* Fixed (hopefully) semiblocks rendering leaking across dimensions (semiblocks are logistics frames, heat frames, crop supports, spawner agitators & transfer gadgets)
* Fixed visual issue with some JEI recipes (explosion crafting, UV light box, PCB etching) seen in newer JEI release

### 0.7.5-248 (26 Jul 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed NPE when using a newly-crafted GPS Area Tool
* Fixed Amadron offers not syncing properly in 'Open to LAN' worlds
* Fixed client kick when trying to add periodic Amadron offers on dedicated server

### 0.7.4-244 (25 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Amadron Tablet has seen a lot of attention...
  * Recoloured GUI background to now match what the item looks like
  * Moved the lesser-used "Add Trade" button into its own "Custom Trades" side tab. This button often appeared to get confused with the "Place Order" button beside it, which is what most players more often want to do.
  * Also in "Custom Trades", added 2 buttons which admin players can use to add custom periodic & static trades via the GUI.  Players need the "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addPeriodicTrade" and/or "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade" Forge permission nodes to do this (which by default means being an op). Note that custom periodic trades can't (yet) be removed via GUI; edit the "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersPeriodic.cfg" & "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg" files to do that.
  * Also added a button for admin players to add custom static trades via the GUI, with the same restrictions as for custom periodic trades (permission node "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade", file "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg").
  * "Place Order" button is now greyed out when the basket is empty
  * Added audible feedback when an order is successfully placed
  * Trade items with NBT are now supported (e.g. vanilla potions or enchanted books, and many modded items).  Note that the Amadron system will always try to match exactly the metadata and NBT you added the trade with.
* A bit more work (hopefully the last) on smoother fluid tank updates to client
* Can now install up to 10 Jet Boots upgrades in the Pneumatic Boots.  10 upgrades allows hovering in-place, but watch out for the in-flight air cost...
* Some tile entity performance improvements, most notably with the (output mode) Pressure Chamber Interface which was wasting a lot of CPU time but also to a lesser degree with the Air Compressor, UV Light Box and Sentry Turret
* Drones are now 50% faster (this makes up for the fact that they don't travel diagonally anymore)
* Performance improvements with the Charging Module (similar to Charging Station improvements in 0.7.3 release)
* Minigun ammo can now also be crafted with splash & lingering potions to get the corresponding splash/linger effect. But be warned, splash ammo get used up 3 times as fast, and lingering ammo 6 times as fast.
* Minigun ammo potion proc chance is now configurable - see I:minigunPotionProcChance in config)
* Added 3 methods to the Drone Interface computer peripheral: getDroneName(), getOwnerName(), getOwnerID()
* Magma blocks are now treated as heat sources
* Made the thermal resistance of non-vanilla fluids configurable - see D:fluidThermalResistance.  Default is 10; higher values make heat move from fluids to adjacent heat handlers more slowly.
#### Fixes
* Fixed Amadron restocking/payout drones (for player-player trading) spawning twice
* Fixed custom Amadron fluid trades not working
* Fixed NPE when trying to extract items from bottom side of Aerial Interface
* Fixed some armor features (magnet, charging) functioning even without the necessary upgrades installed
* Fixed Minigun Ammo not being craftable

### 0.7.3-239 (16 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Reworked 3rd party wrench support: many more wrenches are now supported
* More performance work with fluid tank sync'ing, reducing the rate at which tanks sync to client
* Charging Station now performs far better with many Speed Upgrades installed (was causing severe FPS drops)
* A few IGW updates, in particular the new Pneumatic Armor pieces are now documented
* Shift-left-clicking a GPS Tool in the Programmer GUI now creates a corresponding Area puzzle piece (this is an addition to the existing Left-Click to create a Coordinate puzzle piece)
#### Fixes
* Toggling jet boots off while thrusting no longer causes a desync
* Area GPS Tool now works on dedicated servers
* Mechanic Villagers created in the Pressure Chamber now have the right set of trades
* Wrenching PNC machines with 3rd party wrenches no longer also opens the machine's GUI
* Wrenching Pressure Tubes with 3rd party wrenches no longer causes a crash, and works as expected
* Breaking tile entities with empty fluid tanks no longer writes empty NBT data to the dropped item (so it will stack with other fresh items of the same type)
* Partially fixed navigation in the Coordinate Tracker upgrade for the helmet.  This needs more work, though (pathfinding has changed significantly since the upgrade was first created back in MC 1.6/1.7)

### 0.7.2-234 (11 Jul 2018)
#### Updates
* Pneumatic Door now plays a (suitably pneumatic) opening/closing sound effect.
* Some performance improvement work, particularly around Omni and Liquid Hoppers.  In particular, extracting from the Refinery with Liquid Hoppers caused significant FPS drops.
* Liquid Hoppers no longer accept input fluids on their output face, and will no longer output fluids from their input face.  (Related to performance improvements mentioned above)
* Tile Entities with fluid tanks now send far fewer updates to the client (also related to aforementioned performance work).  Previously they sent an update whenever the tank's contents changed, which is overkill for just rendering fluids.  Now updates are only sent when the contents change by more than 1% of the tank's total capacity. Can be adjusted in config - see 'D:liquidTankUpdateThreshold'.
#### Fixes
* Added back a missing texture for Aphorism Tile
* Fixed a server crash caused by a null ItemStack reference in Amadron custom offer handling

### 0.7.1-231 (9 Jul 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fixed startup crash under some circumstances (most likely with Thaumcraft not installed) related to new Pneumatic Armor
* No longer attempts to render armor initialisation progress bar if armor piece has no pressure

### 0.7.0-228 (8 Jul 2018)
#### New
* Big new feature: a fully-fledged Pneumatic Armor suite!  Added in Pneumatic Chestplate, Leggings & Boots, each with their own upgrades and abilities (read on...)
* To see all upgrades and abilities for each armor piece, put them in a Charging Station, and open the upgrade inventory from the Charging Station GUI (click the "Inv." button)
* Charging Upgrades (1-5) in the Chestplate charge all pressurizable armor and items you're carrying from the Chestplate's air tank (the Chestplate has a very large tank by default, and all pieces can be further upgraded with Volume Upgrades)
* Security Upgrade in the Chestplate gives protection from fire & lava (pressure cost: high)
* Magnet Upgrade (1-6) in the Chestplate attracts nearby items to the player (pressure cost: very low).  The Magnet respects Immersive Engineering's Conveyor Belts (in fact any item entity with the "PreventRemoteMovement" NBT tag) and Botania's Solegnolia.
* Speed Upgrades (1-3) in the Leggings give a run speed boost (pressure cost: very low)
* Range Upgrades (1-6) in the Leggings give a jump boost (pressure cost: low)
* Dispenser Upgrades (1-4) in the Boots allow you to kick entities for moderate damage and heavy knockback (pressure cost: low)
* The Pneumatic Boots give step assist for free and fall protection for a modest pressure cost (depending on the height of the fall)
* Jet Boots Upgrades (1-8) in the Boots allow limited flight (pressure cost: high)
* Pneumatic Armor has the same armor rating as iron, but +1 Toughness (for comparison, diamond armor has +2 Toughness)
* Armor Upgrades (1-4) in any armor piece increase its protection and toughness.  2 Armor Upgrades will provide protection equivalent to diamond, 4 upgrades is superior to diamond.
* Item Life Upgrades (1-6) in any armor piece allow auto-repair at a cost of pressure.  More upgrades cause faster, but less air-efficient, repair.
* All Pneumatic Helmet functions remain available; just to note that Horses can now be tamed via helmet hacking.
* All features can be toggled on/off using the familiar Pneumatic Helmet options GUI, and as before, keys can be bound to toggle any feature without opening the GUI.
#### Updates
* Quality of Life: shift-clicking a Pneumatic armor piece while in the Charging Station GUI will move it to the right place (armor slots -> charging slot, charging slot -> armor slot, player inv slots -> charging slot)
* Aphorism Tiles are now considered passable by drones, like vanilla signs.  (Note Aphorism Tiles will not be washed away by water, so useful for an underwater base)
* Performance: Aphorism Tiles are no longer ticking tile entities.
* Aphorism Tiles can now be recoloured by right-clicking with any dye (oredict-aware).  Tile border and background can be recoloured independently.
* Drones will now auto-equip the best (highest damage, taking enchantments into account) weapon in their inventory when entering combat (only applies with upgraded inventories, of course).
* Handheld minigun now has a proper rotating model!
* Minigun bullets cause a (cosmetic) particle effect on blocks they hit.  No block breaking, though.
#### Fixes
* Drones have been taught how to melee 1.9 style.  They were still fighting 1.7.10 style, which made them hopeless at melee.
* Hacked drones will no longer obnoxiously shove their owner around; instead they'll come to the owner and land in front of them.
* Fix: better behaviour for drones when targeting entities they can't pathfind to (they were getting stuck in a about-to-teleport loop)
* Fix: server crash if a drone carrying multiple buckets tried to milk a cow.  Now the drone will drop any milk buckets that it has no inventory space for on the ground.
* Fix: Pressure Chambers with multiple valves will now be properly reformed when world is reloaded (previously auxiliary valves didn't think they were part of the multiblock, and leaked air)
* Fix: right clicking a refinery block with a bucket or other fluid container will now extract the right fluid (previously it always tried to extract from the bottom block in the stack, regardless of which block was clicked)
* Fix: the Light Condition puzzle piece was miscalculating light levels

### 0.6.8-219 (27 Jun 2018)
#### Updates
* Change to Drones and Security Upgrades (liquid protection): 1 Security Upgrade will now allow drones to swim through liquids, 2 Security Upgrades will create a temporary 3x3x3 air bubble around drones which are in a liquid, and 3+ Security Upgrades will permanently remove any liquids a drone flies through.  Drones will still never pathfind through lava, though.
#### Fixes
* Fixed Computer Control program piece not getting registered with Open Computers installed
* Fixed drones having their AI overridden by carried entities (Entity Import program piece)
* Fixed inability to place Heat Frames on inventories
* Fixed possible lockup (endless loop) on startup with drones
* Fixed spurious "Drone has no UUID!" error messages on the client
* Fixed occasional crashes when teleporting into areas with client-side (TESR) renderers

### 0.6.7-210 (10 Jun 2018)

#### New
* Added support for Thaumcraft 6.  Thaumcraft Upgrade is now craftable and adds Goggles of Revealing functionality to the Pneumatic Helmet.  Aspects have been added to a few PneumaticCraft items (beyond any Thaumcraft auto-detection).
* The Omnidirectional Hopper and Liquid Hopper now have comparator support to measure their fullness.

#### Updates
* Logistics Drones now grab as many of the requested item type as can fit in a single item stack, instead of taking simply the first stack from the inventory.
* Upgrade descriptions for Pneumatic Helmet & Drones in the Charging Station GUI are now much more complete and accurate; all applicable upgrades are documented, and inapplicable upgrades are no longer shown and cannot be installed (e.g. Logistics Drones can't use Dispenser Upgrades).
* Particles in the Pressure Chamber are slightly less dense now, and render higher inside the chamber.  Allows items in the chamber to actually be seen when the pressure is high; previously particle cloud obscured any items.
* Any items crafted with Air Canisters now get any air in the canister(s)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Sync issue with Pressure Gauge GUI toggling the '<' / '>' button.
* Fix: crash with Ice & Fire Cyclops attacking Sentry Turrets
* Fix: dedicated server crash with drones and the Magnet Upgrade
* Fix: dedicated server crash when hacking mob spawners with Pneumatic Helmet
* Fix: client desync for Logistics Frames after configuring them with Logistics Configurator
* Fix: Logistics Frames & other semiblocks not always sync'ing properly to the client on initial player login
* Fix: items not always transferring in Logistics Network (using tubes & Logistics Modules)
* Fix: it's now possible to place blocks against GUI-less blocks like Compressed Iron Block without needing to sneak-right-click

### 0.6.6-192 (14 May 2018)

#### Updates
* The Universal Sensor no longer uses air in the "Constant" redstone emitter mode (still requires minimum pressure though)
#### Fixes
* Fix: crash when right-clicking some PneumaticCraft blocks with other mods' wrenches
* Fix: another fix to Speed Upgrade crafting with stacks of more than one item in the table

### 0.6.5-189 (11 May 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: crash when crafting Speed Upgrades in some situations.
* Fix: Gas Lift now works with infinite fluid blocks such as Better With Addons Aqueducts.

### 0.6.4-186 (3 May 2018)

#### Updates
* Compressed Iron Gear now added to Ore Dictionary as "gearIronCompressed".  This allows Thermal Expansion Compactor to craft Compressed Iron Gears when the Gearworking Die Augment is installed.
* Plastic Mixer JEI page now uses Ore Dictionary to show the dyes instead of hard-coded vanilla dye items. (Mods and/or packs can remove vanilla dyes from the oredict so hardcoded items can be misleading)
#### Fixes
* Fix: client crash when looking at RFTools Powercells with the Pneumatic Helmet Block Upgrade Tracker active (and RF scanning enabled).  The RF scanner still doesn't get the RF level; a more comprehensive data syncing framework for the Pneumatic Helmet is being considered.
* Fix: Removed Upgrade Info tab from Refinery GUI (the block doesn't take any upgrades)
* Fix: Nasty item-equip sound loop being played when Pneumatic Helmet equipped and Charging Station GUI open

### 0.6.3-181 (25 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Shift-click dupe bug (introduced in 0.6.0) when clicking items into some PneumaticCraft inventories.
* Fix: Dyeing a drone by right-clicking it now only uses one dye from the stack, not two.
* Fix: Blocks can now be placed against the Charging Station & Elevator Caller with sneak-right-click.

### 0.6.2-179 (24 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Server crash when Spawner Agitators are used in conjunction with the Despawning Spawners mod.
* Fix: Omnidirectional Hoppers now respect the sidedness of the block they pull from (e.g. will no longer pull input items or fuel from the bottom side of a vanilla furnace).

### 0.6.1-176 (22 Apr 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix: Crash with liquid lookup with JEI.
* Fix: Drones being quirky sometimes when digging.

### 0.6.0-174 (21 Apr 2018)

#### New
* Added Harvesting Drone, and Harvesting Piece.
* QoL improvement: Speed Upgrades can now be crafted with fluid containers holding more than a bucket of lubricant.  The Liquid Hopper works for this, and the Thermal Expansion and EnderIO tanks can also be used.  Other mods' containers may also work.
#### Updates
* QoL improvement: adding extra Refinery blocks to an existing stack will now automatically redistribute any output fluids to the appropriate tanks, so the Refinery can continue to run.  E.g. adding a Refinery to a 2-block stack which already contains Diesel and LPG will auto-move the LPG from the second to the third (newly added) block.
* Programmable Controller: all faces except the bottom face can be used to access the fake drone's inventory.  The bottom face can be used to insert or extract the programmable item (Drone or Network API).
* QoL improvement: Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now only accepts items/fluids that can be used in recipes.
#### Fixes
* Fix (cosmetic): Amadron no longer shows slot highlights where there isn't a trade widget (i.e. on the last page of trades).
* Fix: Breaking any PneumaticCraft tile entity with an auto-smelt pick (e.g. from Tinker's Construct) no longer smelts the tile entity's contents.
* Fix: MCMP2 support hard-disabled for now (switching it on in config would crash your game before)
* Fix: Elevator Caller now works properly when you have more than 12 floors
* Fix: Programmable Controller inventory handling now works properly (inventory manipulation widgets were accessing the controller's 1-slot inventory instead of the fake drone's inventory)
* Fix: Removing the programmable item (Drone or Network API) from the Programmable Controller's slot now properly stops and resets the running program.
* Fix: Rotating PNC blocks with other mods' wrenches should no longer also open the block's GUI.
* Fix: The Charging Station now only allows 1 item to be inserted, to prevent duping Machine Upgrades.
* Performance: fluid tank rendering now uses a FastTESR, better for client FPS.

### 0.5.1-163 (21 Mar 2018)
#### Updates
* Drones now also render held hoes upside down (just like other tools).
* Inserting/extracting the top side of the Programmable Controller block inserts/extracts "drone" inventory.
#### Fixes
* Fixed the Programmable Controller since the initial port (most notably a crash involving FTB Utilities).
* Fix server crash with Mekanism cardboard box & spawner agitator

### 0.5.0-159 (26 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Added GPS Area Tool, a way to make selecting areas with the Programmer easier.
* You can 'paste' Coordinate puzzle pieces in the Programmer by taking a GPS Tool and left-clicking it on the programming area (the GPS Area Tool does the same for the Area piece).
* Oil worldgen can now be blacklisted by dimension ID (e.g. disable oil generation in Twilight Forest) - see I:oilWorldGenBlacklist in pneumaticcraft.cfg
#### Updates
* Drones & Logistics Drones can now be spawned from a Dispenser
* Altered camera orientations for some held items (wrenches & other tools - thanks Teamspen210)
* Gas Lift air (pressure) usage when extending the tube is now dependent on the hardness of the block being broken (stone is the same, softer blocks are cheaper, and obsidian is much more expensive to break)
* Advanced Pressure Tubes can now be used in the Gas Lift, and will reduce the pressure cost to break blocks to 50%
* The Spawner Agitator is now found 10x less frequently in dungeon loot chests (it can still be crafted, though)
* Reworked some event handling code which should provide a significant performance improvement in worlds with many loaded tile entities
#### Fixes
* RF Import & RF Export programming pieces are now available (they were in, but registration was getting skipped due to a bug).  Also note that despite the name, these pieces work with Forge Energy, which is RF-compatible.
* Fixed a crash with the Amadron Tablet when adding a trade when not having a item supply location bound to the tablet
* Fixed Drones sometimes refusing to teleport while they should (most likely to notice with Place Block commands)
* Fixed entity filters in Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker module not working on dedicated servers
* Hopefully fixed server-side NPE with Programmable Controller and FTB Utilities claim protection
* Fixed Gas Lift being able to break unbreakable blocks (bedrock, ender portal frames...)

### 0.4.1-141 (10 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Added config option 'B:explosionCrafting', true by default. Setting this to false disables explosion crafting of compressed iron. If you disable this, you'll need another way to get initial compressed iron (e.g. via a CraftTweaker recipe)
#### Fixes
* Hopefully made PNC:R more robust with compatibility with other mods adding "oil" as a fluid.  PNC:R will now log an error and disable oil worldgen if it can't find oil as a block, rather than crashing the instance.
* Picking up modded fluids with Ceramics Clay Bucket no longer converts the Clay Bucket to a vanilla iron Bucket.
* Drone "Condition: Items" puzzle piece now works properly.
* Fixed potential client-side NPE in Aphorism Tiles when drama text is unavailable.

### 0.4.0-135 (1 Feb 2018)
#### New
* Programmer Area enhancements: Sphere, Cylinder and Pyramid types can now be configured as 'hollow', and the Area widget configuration GUI now has a much cleaner layout
* Programmer enhancement: added a search textfield, shown when the full widget tray is expanded, allowing easy location of puzzle pieces by name
* Programmer widget tray can now be toggled with the Tab hotkey (in addition to the existing Space hotkey), possibly useful when the new search field has focus
* Aerial Interface: added support for CoFH "Essence of Knowledge" experience fluid
* Aerial Interface: the Experience tab in the GUI now has a button to select the desired fluid type when you have multiple mods providing experience fluids (the old method of inserting some fluid to set the accepted type no longer works)
* Added two ComputerCraft methods for Elevators: getCurrentHeight() and getTargetHeight()
#### Updates
* Drone death messages to the owner are now more informative (include reason why drone died)
* Minigun tracers and Vortex entities no longer look so weird (bad X offset) when fired from the left hand
* IGW updates to Aerial Interface and Programmer wiki pages
#### Fixes
* Fixed client being kicked when trying to load very large drone programs from pastebin (exceeding 32K client->server packet limit; now sent in multiple packets - 1.7.10 had a higher packet size limit)
* Fixed client crash when using variables to define areas (related to changes in 0.3.0 regarding size limit validation)
* Fixed client crash in Programmer when zooming all the way out, exiting Programmer and then re-opening it
* Fixed some XP calculation inaccuracies in the Aerial Interface; pumping XP in & out should not cause any unexpected XP loss or gain now
* Fixed missing textures in the Area wiki page

### 0.3.1-125 (18 Jan 2018)
#### Fixes
* Fix AbstractMethodError crashes introduced in 0.3.0.

### 0.3.0-124 (17 Jan 2018)
#### New
* Added Transfer Widget, an early game item/fluid transfer item that can be placed _between_ blocks.
* Added Spawner Agitator, which keeps Mob Spawners active even if players are not around.
* Added Crop Support, an item which when placed on a crop improves growth speed.
#### Updates
* Network Data Storage item now shows required puzzle pieces in its item tooltip when holding Shift
* Big performance improvement when searching in the item search GUI
* Better default orientation of the Omnidirection Hopper when it's placed: output now faces the clicked block, and input faces the player.
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas has been increased from 100,000 to 250,000 and can now be adjusted in config (see I:maxProgrammingArea)
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas is now validated in the Programmer before the drone is programmed, instead of forcing a drone with an over-large area to suicide after it's placed.
* Performance improvement: the tile entities for Pressure Chamber Wall/Glass & Elevator Frames no longer tick. Pressure Chamber Glass should be fine to use in small-scale decorative builds, or for its excellent blast-resistant properties. 
* Lots of work (mainly cleanup) on the In-Game-Wiki docs.
#### Fixes
* Fixed (hopefully) reflection-based crashes on startup when running with certain ASM-using coremods
* Fixed NPE's when breaking certain inventories or tanks with a Logistics Frame attached
